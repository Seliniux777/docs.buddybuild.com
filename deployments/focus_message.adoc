= Release Notes

Notify users of recent changes in your app with release notes. They can
be used as a change log for your app's latest features, or to notify
testers which specific areas they should target for feedback.

In buddybuild, release notes can be entered in two ways:

. **In the buddybuild dashboard**
+
Within the buddybuild dashboard, select the build you'd like to publish
release notes for and enter them under the 'Deploy' tab of the build
details.

. **The text file within your repository**
+
You can also add release notes by creating and checking in a file called
`buddybuild_release_notes.txt` in the root of your repository.
Buddybuild will automatically use the content included in this file to
build release notes.

[NOTE]
======
If you don't specify a focus message, buddybuild automatically uses the
commit message of your last commit as your next deployment's release
notes!
