= Code Signing 101

Buddybuild takes away the pain of having to deal with code signing by
link:../../../quickstart/ios/invite_testers.adoc[automatically uploading
certificates] and
link:../../../quickstart/ios/apple_developer_portal_sync.adoc[auto-syncing
provisioning profiles] so you can focus on building great apps instead.

If you'd like to learn more about code signing, read on.

== Certificates and Private Keys

Device builds on iOS are required to be signed with a developer's
certificate. Code signing allows iOS devices to verify the app
developer's identity, and that the app has not been tampered with.

Developer identities are tied to two artifacts -- a certificate and a
private key that unlocks the certificate. Both these artifacts are
probably already present if you've ever deployed builds to a device.

Typically, there are two types of certificates available to iOS
developers -- one is a development certificate used for local development
and testing -- the other is a distribution certificate meant for builds
destined for the App Store.

If you're part of the Apple Enterprise program, you also have an
Enterprise Distribution certificate that allows you to deploy apps
within your enterprise.

You must code sign iOS applications before any iOS devices will accept
them for installation.

Buddybuild creates builds on your behalf, so we need access to your
developer identities in order to sign builds. Managing these can be a
pain. Use the link:../../../quickstart/ios/invite_testers.adoc[Automatic
Cert-Uploader] to quickly and easily upload the relevant certificates to
buddybuild.

== Provisioning Profiles

Development devices also need to be included in the Provisioning Profile
of the development-signed app bundle before they can accept them for
installation.

Provisioning profiles are generated and signed by Apple. Any
modifications -- like adding a new device UDID -- requires the
following:

- A request to Apple to regenerate the profile,
- Download and installation of the generated profile on to your
  development machine,
- Rebuilding your app with the updated profile.

Buddybuild can also transparently manage these for you. Simply enable
the
link:../../../quickstart/ios/apple_developer_portal_sync.adoc[Auto-Syncing
Provisioning Profiles] feature to take advantage of this functionality!
