Manage your Code Signing Identities and Provisioning profiles right from
within buddybuild.

First, select the **App Settings** button.

If your Code Signing Identities need to be updated, click **Upload new
certificates.**

Next, use the **Automatic-Cert Uploader ** by copying the command and
running it in terminal.

We highly recommend letting buddybuild
link:../../../quickstart/ios/apple_developer_portal_sync.adoc[automatically
manage your provisioning profiles] for you.

However if you want to manage them yourself, you can add, update or
delete specific profiles in this panel.
