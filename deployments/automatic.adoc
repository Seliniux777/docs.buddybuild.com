= Automatic deployments

With buddybuild, you can precisely control who gets what build, by
managing your testers and beta users with deployment groups.
Automatically deploy to your groups - either per build or on a set
schedule.

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Configure Deployment Schedule

To schedule automated deployments, first locate the group you would like
to automatically deploy to, or create a new group if you prefer.

Next, click on the first dropdown to reveal the deployment options. To
automatically deploy to a group, select either **each build**, or
**scheduled**.

[NOTE]
======
**Each build**: automatically deploys to a group after each successful
build +
**Scheduled**: automatically deploys to a group at a specific time on
selected days of the week.

[[step2]]
== Step 2: Select Branch Targets

You can configure your deployment groups to receive builds from specific
branches. For example, you might only want to push builds from the
'release' branch to the 'Product Managers' group.

First, click on the branch dropdown to reveal a list of branches. Select
one or more branches that you would like to automatically deploy from.

Next, select one or more schemes (iOS) or variants (Android) that you
would like to deploy.

[NOTE]
======
**Selecting Multiple Schemes / Variants:**

Buddybuild displays all schemes and variants found across all branches.
However, buddybuild will only deploy successfully when the
scheme/variant exists within the building branch.

That's it! The next successful build, based on the criteria you set,
will automatically be sent to the configured deployment group!
