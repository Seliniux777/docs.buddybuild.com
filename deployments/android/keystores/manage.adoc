= Managing your KeyStores

If you wish to override the buddybuild-generated KeyStore during your
build, you can upload your own. Buddybuild notices the uploaded KeyStore
and uses it for code signing your App.

[NOTE]
======
**Release build keystores**

Release builds -- like the ones that eventually end up in the Play Store
-- must be code signed with a _release_ KeyStore that is associated with
a Developer. See link:README.adoc[KeyStore basics] for details.
======

[CAUTION]
=========
**Verify the keystore**

You can run `keytool -list -keystore .keystore -alias foo` to verify
that the KeyStore alias and password matches.
=========


== Step 1: Upload a KeyStore from your development machine

Start by clicking on **App Settings**.

Next, select **Build settings**, then **APK signing keystores**.

keystores button", 1500, 800]

Locate the KeyStore on your local machine and upload it. It is typically
a file with a .keystore or .jks extension. Enter your KeyStore password,
alias and alias password.

Once uploaded, you will see your keystore listed on the page.

== Step 2: Assign the keystore to an application variant

Next, assign your keystore to an application variant. Buddybuild
builds and signs the variant with the selected keystore.

That's it! Buddybuild now uses your uploaded KeyStore for subsequent
builds.
