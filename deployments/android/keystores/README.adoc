= KeyStore basics

Android Applications need to be code signed to be installable on
devices. The signing identities are bundled in a Java KeyStore file --
typically with the extension `.keystore` or `.jks`.

Debug builds are typically code signed with an auto-generated _debug_
KeyStore. Release builds -- like the ones that eventually end up in the
Play Store -- must be code signed with a _release_ KeyStore that is
associated with a Developer.

Typically, your KeyStores should be checked into your source control
repository. The repo's `build.gradle` file references these KeyStores
for each product flavor and build type.

Buddybuild auto-generates _debug_ KeyStores for you. So you'll typically
never have to manage KeyStores yourself when deploying your app to
testers.

If you already have a KeyStore that identifies you or your development
team, you can upload this to buddybuild. Every subsequent build of your
app uses your uploaded KeyStores.

If you want to publish your app to the Google Play store, a _release_
KeyStore is required. If you do not already have a release KeyStore, you
can generate one with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore -storepass android \
        -alias androidreleasekey -keypass android \
        -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype jks -validity 10000
----

Where:

`-keystore release.keystore`::
  Specifies the name (`release.keystore`) of the KeyStore.

`-storepass android`::
  Specifies the password (`android`) for the KeyStore.

`-alias androidreleasekey`::
  Specifies an name (`androidreleasekey`) for this specific key in the
  KeyStore.

`-keypass android`::
  Specifies the password (`android`) for this specific key in the
  KeyStore.

`-keyalg RSA`::
  Specifies the algorithm (`RSA`) to use when generating the key.

`-keysize 2048`::
  Specifies the size of the key in bits (`2048`).

`-storetype jks`::
  Specifies the type of KeyStore to produce (`jks` means "Java
  KeyStore").

`-validity 10000`::
  Specifies the number of years (`10000`) that this key should be valid.

To upload your own KeyStores, follow the guide link:manage.adoc[here].
