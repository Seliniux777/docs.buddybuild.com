= KeyStore Basics

Android Applications need to be code signed to be installable on
devices. The signing identities are bundled in a Java KeyStore file --
typically with the extension `.keystore` or `.jks`.

Debug builds are typically code signed with an auto-generated KeyStore.
Release builds -- like the ones that eventually end up in the Play Store
-- will require to be code signed with a KeyStore that is associated
with a Developer.

Typically, your KeyStores will be checked into your source control
repository. The repo's build.gradle file will reference these KeyStores
for each product flavor and build type.

Buddybuild will auto-generate KeyStores for you. So you'll typically
never have to manage KeyStores yourself. But if you already have a
KeyStore that identifies you or your development team, you can upload
this to buddybuild. Every subsequent build of your app will pick up your
uploaded KeyStores.

To upload your own KeyStores, follow the guide link:manage.adoc[here].
