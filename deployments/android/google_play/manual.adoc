= Deploying manually to Google Play

With buddybuild, you have the ability to manually deploy to Google Play.

[NOTE]
======
**First ensure you have completed the following steps:**

. link:developer_console.adoc[Create a private key and setup
  permissions from the Google Play Developer Console]
. link:../keystores/manage.adoc[Upload Your APK Signing KeyStores]
======

If you have already completed the pre-requisite steps, follow along
below to manually deploy to Google Play!

Log in to buddybuild and head over to the Builds page by selecting
**Builds** in the global navigation menu.

Next, click on the successful build you want to deploy.

and upload the **Google Private Key (`.JSON` file)** that was
automatically downloaded when you created a Service Account.

Click **Connect with Google Play**.

Once the Google Private Key (`.JSON`) file has been uploaded
successfully, you'll see a success message.

Next, select the variant dropdown and **select the variant you want to
upload to Google Play**.

[NOTE]
======
**You must select a _release_ variant to deploy to the Google Play
store.**

If you do not see any release variants in the dropdown menu, it likely
means that no release variants have been built by buddybuild. Buddybuild
does not offer to deploy _debug_ variants to Google Play.
======

A Version Name and Version Code will be automatically filled in for you.
You may choose to give your build a unique Version Name and Version
Code, or choose to leave the default values.

Next, select either the **Production, Beta Testing or Alpha Testing
track** that you want to deploy to Google Play.

[NOTE]

**Buddybuild SDK**

If you have the buddybuild SDK installed, at this point you will be able
to select which SDK features to include in the build that you are
uploading to Google Play.

Next, select **Upload to the Google Play Store**.

[WARNING]
=========
**Warning: Uploading apps that are currently live in the Google Play
Store**

If your app is currently live in the Google Play Store, uploading to the
Production Track will **automatically publish your app and make it
live**.

Uploading to the Beta Testing or Alpha Testing Track will automatically
make your app available to your specified testers from the Google Play
Developer Console.
=========

If your app has not previously been published to the Google Play Store,
head over to the Google Play Developer Console to complete the
deployment process.
