  Buddybuild integrates with Google Play to auto deploy your Android apps.  You
  must first create a service account and set up the proper permissions.

= Create a private key and setup permissions

To deploy builds to Google Play, the first stage of the process is to
create a service account with a JSON-formatted private key (`.json`) and
setup the appropriate permissions from the Google Play Developer
Console.

Lets get started!

[IMPORTANT]
===========
**At this point the JSON private key has been downloaded to your
computer**

You need to upload this file to buddybuild in the next stage.

Make sure that you store the private key in a secure place. If the
private key is deleted or otherwise lost, you cannot retrieve it.
===========

. Return to the **Google Play Developer Console**. Find it in the original
  browser window or tab.

. image:img/button-play-grant_access.png["The Grant Access button", 143,
  45, role="right"]
  Find the just-created service account in the **Service Accounts**
  panel, and click the **Grant Access** button in the same row. The
  **Add a new user** dialog is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-play-add_new_user.png["The Add a new user dialog",

. Adjust permissions for the service account as you see fit. Make sure
that the **Role** dropdown has **Release manager** selected.
