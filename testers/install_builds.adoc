= Installing Builds from buddybuild

As a tester or beta user, installing builds and submitting feedback is
now easier than ever with buddybuild.

Typically, your app's developers would send you an email containing the
build they would like your valuable feedback on. Open this email and
click on the **Install** button.

If this is your first time installing builds from buddybuild, you'll
need to follow a short registration process.


== Device Registration

Simply tap on the **Start Registration** button and then install the
profile. buddybuild uses this registration to identify who sent feedback
on builds.

== Download and Install Build

If you've already registered, you can download your app right away.
Simply hit the **Download** button and then tap **Install** to install
the build.

== Enterprise Signing

Enterprise organizations need to be trusted before their apps can be
run. If you hit this error when opening your app, open up your settings
and trust the organization's profile before launching the app.

=== Install the latest successful build from a specific branch

As a tester, you may want to test a specific branch. For example, you
want to make sure that you're always running the latest version
available on your _staging_ branch. To achieve this you can create an
install URL which looks like this:

[[code-samples]]
--
.Install URL
[source,url]
----
https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/download/:platform?appID=:app_id&branch=:branch
----
--

=== Parameters:

. **:platform** -- the platform of your app. Its value can be **"ios"**
  or **"android"**

. **:app_id** -- the identifier of your app. You can find it in your
  browser's search bar when you are viewing your app in the buddybuild
  dashboard.

. **:branch** -- the name of the branch that you want to test. For
  example _master_, _develop_ or _staging_.

. **:scheme** -- (Optional) the scheme to install. This is useful if
  your branch is building multiple schemes.
