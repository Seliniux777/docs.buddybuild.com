= Installing Builds from buddybuild

As a tester or beta user, installing builds and submitting feedback is
now easier than ever with buddybuild.

Typically, your app's developers would send you an email containing the
build they would like your valuable feedback on. Open this email and
click on the **Install** button.

If this is your first time installing builds from buddybuild, you'll
need to follow a short registration process.


== Device Registration

Simply tap on the **Start Registration** button and then install the
profile. buddybuild uses this registration to identify who sent feedback
on builds.

Simply hit the **Download** button and then tap **Install** to install
the build.

== Enterprise Signing

Enterprise organizations need to be trusted before their apps can be
run. If you hit this error when opening your app, open up your settings
and trust the organization's profile before launching the app.
