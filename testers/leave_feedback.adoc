= Leaving Feedback

Notice a typo in your App? Leave feedback for your developers in three
short steps:

. Take a screenshot (iOS) or shake the device (Android)
. Draw a box around the area you would like to highlight
. Enter a comment for your developers and hit send!

Buddybuild will send your feedback straight into your developers'
notification channels.
