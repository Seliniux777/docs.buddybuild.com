= Integration settings for all apps

Each of the available link:../README.adoc[integration] settings are
app-specific. This section describes how you can specify integration
settings that automatically apply to new apps, or that can be applied to
any applications that already exist within an organization.

[IMPORTANT]
Integration settings that can be applied to all apps are available for
the following integrations: the link:../itunes_connect.adoc[Apple
Developer Portal], link:../hipchat.adoc[HipChat],
link:../jira.adoc[JIRA], link:../pivotal_tracker.adoc[Pivotal Tracker],
and link:../slack.adoc[Slack]. For the remaining integrations, the
settings need to be configured for each individual app.
