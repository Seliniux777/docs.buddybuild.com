= Slack

Slack is a popular team-based chat application that has revolutionized
the way that development teams communicate. Buddybuild offers a
first-class integration with Slack, providing notifications of build
status, feedback submissions, and crash reports directly to the Slack
channels that you use.

There are a number of sub-sections on this page:

- <<navigate>>
- <<connect>>
- <<branches>>
- <<channel>>
- <<notifications>>
- <<editing>>
- <<remove_config>>
- <<remove_connection>>
