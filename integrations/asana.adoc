= Asana

Asana is a popular project tracking application used by many agile
development teams. Buddybuild offers a first-class integration with
Asana, creating tasks for build status, feedback submissions, and crash
reports directly to the Asana projects that you use.

There are a number of sub-sections on this page:

- <<navigate>>
- <<connect>>
- <<editing>>
- <<delete_connection>>

role="frame"]

At this point, the initial connection process is complete! You can
adjust the configuration any time you wish.


[[editing]]
== Edit feedback and crash report configuration

The feedback and crash report settings can be adjusted at any time.
Adjustments take effect immediately for all future feedback or crash
report events.

Check **Automatically create tasks for Feedback** if you wish to have
new tasks created every time a user sends feedback via the buddybuild
SDK in your app. Similarly, check **Automatically create tasks for crash
reports** if you wish to have new tasks created every time your app
(with the buddybuild SDK enabled) crashes.

Both Feedback and Crash Reports have their own instances of the
following fields:

- Select the Asana **workspace** where tasks should be created.

- Select the Asana **project** where tasks should be created.

- Optionally, select the Asana **section** to apply to tasks.

- Optionally, select the default assignee for new tasks. Whenever new
  tasks are created, the selected user would see those tasks appear in
  Asana's **My Tasks** screen.

Changes to any of the selections is automatically saved.


[[delete_connection]]
== Delete Asana connection

image:img/button-trashcan.png["The Trashcan icon", 57, 47, role="right"]
When you need to delete the Asana connection settings, click the
**Trashcan** icon to the right of **Connected account** panel.

image:img/panel-asana-connected_account.png["The Connected account

The panel is replace by a confirmation panel:

image:img/panel-asana-delete_confirmation.png["The Connection delete
confirmation panel", 900, 46]

Click **Delete** to delete the connection to Asana, or **Cancel** to
keep the configuration.
