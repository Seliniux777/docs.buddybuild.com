Pivotal Tracker is a lightweight, agile project management tool for
software teams.

Buddybuild can be configured to automatically open a Pivotal Tracker
issue for each piece of feedback you receive on your app.

To configure this integration, generate a new API token from your
Pivotal Tracker account.

Once created, copy this API token.
