= Authentication failed

If your build fails fairly quickly with an error like this:

[source,text]
----
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://repository/organization/repo.git'
----

The problem is likely due to one of the following issues:

- The user that connected your repository to buddybuild has left your
  organization and their credentials have been revoked.

- GitHub permissions have changed such that the user who connected your
  repository no longer has access.

- The personal access token required to access your repo has been
  revoked.

- The SSH key used to access your repository has been deleted.

- The repository has been renamed, so that the URL listed in the error
  message is no longer valid.

If possible, you can try to revert the changes that caused these
problems. Otherwise, you'll need to contact buddybuild support using
Intercom (click the blue circle in the bottom right) or
mailto:support@buddybuild.com[via email].
