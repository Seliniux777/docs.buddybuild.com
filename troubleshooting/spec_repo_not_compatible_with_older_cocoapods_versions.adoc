= Spec repo not compatible with older CocoaPods versions

On Nov 11, 2016, the CocoaPods team introduced a breaking change that
affects customers using 0.x versions of CocoaPods.

You can read the details of this change on their blog here:
https://blog.cocoapods.org/Sharding/

If you are using an older version of CocoaPods, you might start seeing
failures in buddybuild. You would very likely see the same errors if you
run `pod install` locally.

There are a few options you can try:

- Upgrade to CocoaPods 1.x
- Check your `Pods` folder into your git repository
