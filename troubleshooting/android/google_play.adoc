  Troubleshooting common Google Play store errors such as track is listed as

= Google Play Errors

The number one issue related to Google Play errors occurs when one of
your tracks is listed as being "Superseded" by a later track. This
precludes any automated system from pushing an APK to any earlier track,
as the system is in a state whereby a later track (i.e. `production`) has
a version code greater than an earlier track (i.e. `alpha`, `beta`).

track has been superseded by the Production track", 777, 469]

Other common issues are:

. You are attempting to upload an APK signed with a different keystore
  that what's already uploaded.

. You are attempting to upload a debuggable APK.

. You are attempting to upload an APK into a later track with a higher
  `versionCode` than an APK in an earlier track.

. You are attempting to upload an APK with the same `versionCode` as one
  that has already been uploaded.

. You are attempting to run two tests across two different tracks in
  Google Play at the same time.

Google has documented the restrictions on version codes/testing/tracks
here (we've quoted the relevant portions):

[NOTE]
======
**Version code requirements**

Alpha testing group users are eligible for the alpha, beta, or
production version of your app (with the highest version code that's
compatible with their device). Beta testing group users are only
eligible for the beta or production version of your app (with the
highest version code that's compatible with their device).

**This means your alpha APKs should have the highest version codes,
followed by beta, and finally production.**

If a beta APK is uploaded with a higher version code than an alpha APK,
alpha users who can install both will install the beta APK instead of
the alpha APK.

If a production APK is uploaded with a higher version code than an alpha
or beta APK, some or all of your alpha and beta users will install the
production APK, instead of APKs of the testing tracks.

For more information, learn about versioning your apps.

[NOTE]
======
**Running Multiple Tests**

If you want to run multiple tests on the same app, keep the following in
mind:

**We recommend you set up one test as a closed alpha and another as an
open beta.** This works because you can run one test at a time per
testing method (e.g. open & closed).

If you run an open alpha test, you can't use the open or closed beta
track. This happens because you can't run two open tests simultaneously
or run a closed beta given version code requirements.

[WARNING]
=========
**Automated Google Play Deployment**

Based off what we've observed, there seems to be additional restrictions
when deploying using Google's APIs, compared to uploading APKs manually
using the Google Play console.

In other words, you might be able to upload an APK manually while
uploading using buddybuild might fail due to additional rules that must
be respected when using their APIs.

== Troubleshooting Errors

=== MultiApkShadowedActiveApk

"Version <version> of this app can not be downloaded by any devices as
they will all receive APKs with higher version codes."

This error indicates that there lies ***another*** APK with the
indicated `versionCode` in one of your tracks, that precludes you from
uploading your APK.

One of the likely reasons for this error is that you're trying to push
an APK with a higher version code to a later track (i.e. beta) than what
is in your earlier tracks (i.e. alpha).

Another possibly reason is that one of your tracks is listed as being
"Superseded" by a later track in your Google Play console.

You are **not** allowed to do this via automated deployment.
