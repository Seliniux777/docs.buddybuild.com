[NOTE]
======
Buddybuild uses Google's firebase to run tests.

== Unable to find instrumentation info for `.*`

This indicates that your instrumentation test APK does not have tests or the
test runner used against your test APK is invalid.

== java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported ISO 3166 country:

This indicates that your test is dependent on locales, and the default locale
configured to be used on firebase ("en") does not work for your tests.

We plan to eventually roll out a feature to configure the locale for your tests,
 but in the meantime, please contact us via Intercom to correct for this.
