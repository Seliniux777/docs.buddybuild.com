= User not getting alert when a new version of app is available

Our SDK allows your testers to be notified when a new version of your
application is available
link:../sdk/automatic_update.adoc[via an alert]. Here's a
checklist of the conditions required for this feature to work:

[%interactive]
- [ ] **Enable the automatic app-update** +
  The Automatic App-Update is activated by default but check your App
  Settings to make sure it is still enabled. If it's not, then your
  users won't get notified that a new version is available next time
  they open your app.

Feature Settings page", 3000, 800]

- [ ] **The build must be deployed via email** +
  Users will only be notified about new **deployed** versions of your
  application. Make sure that you either **manually deployed** a new
  build:

Deploy tab selected", 1500, 869]
+
Or that you use link:../deployments/automatic.adoc[automated deployment].

- [ ] **The SDK must be installed on the previous version of the app** +
  If your users are running a version they installed **before** you
  integrated the SDK into your application, they won't get notified
  about the new version available via the app.
+
They will have to install the new build via the notification they got
via email. Once this build is installed, they will be notified of the
subsequent available versions of your application.

- [ ] **The user must be identified** +
  We need to be able to identify the user before showing the new version
  alert. To achieve that, we use a certificate. To ensure that the user
  not getting the notification is properly identified, use the feedback
  feature of the SDK.

If the feedback appears from an **Unknown user** then something went
wrong with the user's device. To fix it, ask your user to perform the
following tasks in the **General** > **Profile** section of the
**Settings panel**.

to navigate to the Profile settings, and deleting a profile", 1500, 915]
+
Then, visit https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/reset **in Safari on your
iPhone**. Once this is done, you can ask your users to visit the
installation page again.

- [ ] **User must only have one device registered** +
Currently, the update notification is keyed to the user's **email
address**, not the device. Installing a new version on the iPad will
**cancel the update notification** from showing on the iPhone.
