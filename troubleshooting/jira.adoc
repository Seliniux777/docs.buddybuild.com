== Feedback screenshots do not appear in buddybuild-generated issue descriptions

If you have enabled the link:../integrations/jira.adoc[JIRA
integration], and are finding that buddybuild-generated issues for
feedback do not have visible screenshots, the problem may be that the
issue descriptions are configured to render as plain text.

To correct this problem:

. Log in to your JIRA instance as a user with JIRA administrator
  privileges.

. image:img/button-jira-gear.png["The JIRA gear button", 46, 40,
  role="right"]
  At the right of the top menu bar, click the gear icon. The
  **Administration** dropdown menu appears:
+
image:img/dropdown-jira-administration.png["The Administration dropdown
menu in JIRA", 184, 314, role="frame"]

. Select **Issues**. The **Issues** administration screen is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-jira-administration-issues.png["The Issues
administration screen in JIRA", 1280, 624, role="frame"]

. In the left navigation bar, within the **Fields** section, click the
  **Field configurations** link. The **View Field configurations**
  screen is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-jira-administration-field_configurations.png["The View
Field Configurations screen in JIRA", 1280, 624, role="frame"]

. Click the **Configure** link to the right of the **Default Field
  Configuration** label. The **View Field Configuration** screen is
  displayed:
+
image:img/screen-jira-administration-field_configuration.png["The View
Field Configuration screen in JIRA", 1280, 624, role="frame"]

. Scroll down to the **Description** area:
+
image:img/panel-jira-field_configuration-description.png["The
description area within the Field configuration screen in JIRA", 941,
34, role="frame"]

. To the right of the **Description** subtitle, click the **Renderers**
  link. The **Edit Field Rendered: Description** screen is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-jira-administration-edit_field_renderer-description.png["The
Edit Field Renderer: Description screen in JIRA", 1280, 465,
role="frame"]

. In the **Active Renderer** selection menu, select **Wiki Style
  Renderer**.

. image:img/button-jira-update.png["The Update button in JIRA", 67,
  30, role="right"]
  Click the **Update** button to use the **Wiki Style Renderer** for
  issue descriptions.

That's it! The screenshots that are included with feedback issues should
now display as images.
