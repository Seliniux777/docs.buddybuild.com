= App crash on launch

If your app crashes on launch, and the
link:../../sdk/README.adoc[buddybuild SDK] has not been installed, it
may not be obvious where to start looking to diagnose the problem.

The most common cause of this issue is a missing `main.jsbundle` file.
Local builds appear to work because the file is available. When the file
is missing from your repository, buddybuild can successfully build your
app but the app crashes on launch.

To confirm the exact cause of a crash on launch, examination of the
device's logs is necessary. If the buddybuild SDK has been installed,
you can check the dashboard for a crash report. Otherwise, see
link:getting_device_logs_from_xcode.adoc[getting device logs from
Xcode].
