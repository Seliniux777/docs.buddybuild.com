= Installing Apple's Updated Intermediate WWDR Certificate

On February 14th, 2016, the original Apple's Intermediate WWDR
certificate expired. To make sure you can keep building locally, and
using buddybuild's certificate uploader tools, you should make sure you
have the latest version of the intermediate certificate.

If you see something like this in Keychain, then the problem affects
you.

== Download and install the new certificate

Go to https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/ and download the
certificate marked **WWDR Certificate (Expiring 02/07/23)**.

Once you have downloaded that, double click on it to install it.

== Remove any copies of the old certificate

Simply installing the new certificate is not enough. You must remove
copies of the old one too.

By default, Keychain does not show expired certificates, which makes
them had to find.

Go to *View* and make sure you have clicked *Show Expired Certificates*.

Then look for **Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification
Authority** in both the login and System keychains. You will see the red
expired cross next to it. Delete it from both.

=== Certificates are now valid

If you've performed all these steps, you will now see that your
certificates are valid again.
