= Getting device logs from Xcode

When trying to diagnose why a build does not install or an issue with
your app or our SDK, it can be useful to retrieve device logs.

[IMPORTANT]
===========
Run Xcode and connect your device **before** the events that you wish to
capture would occur. This is especially important when trying to
diagnose app installation issues; if you run Xcode and connect your
device after an installation failure, none of the installation errors
are recorded.
===========

. Connect your phone to your laptop and open Xcode

  Make sure that the logs are expanded. If they are not, press the small
  up arrow in the bottom left corner of the main pane.

  log information within the console.
