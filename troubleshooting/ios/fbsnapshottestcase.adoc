When the `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE` environment variable is set to `disabled`,
this removes all system logs. It also removes `NSLog` from your
application on iOS 11.

The solution is to set `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE=default`, which continues to
remove all system logs, but keeps `NSLog` and screenshots can be
successfully generated.

To specify/change the setting for `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE` in Xcode, follow
these steps:

. Open the **Product** menu and select **Scheme -> Edit Scheme...**. The
  scheme dialog appears:
+

role="frame"]

. Click **Run** in the left-hand panel of the dialog.

. Click **Arguments** in the top navigation of the dialog.

. In the **Environment Variables** pane, create/set the value for
  `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE` to `default`.
