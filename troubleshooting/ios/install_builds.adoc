= Trouble installing builds on iOS

Many different kinds of problems can interfere or prevent installing an
iOS application onto a device. This page describes a process for
determining where the problem likely lies, and provides solutions for
the most common issues.

. Try to install a build. Installation failure could be due to one of
  these issues:

- <<no_build_available>>
- <<will_not_install>>
- <<unable_to_download>>
- <<nothing_happens>>
- <<profile_failed>>

. link:getting_device_logs_from_xcode.adoc[Collect the device logs]

. Inspect the logs for errors. If any are found, they should help you
  determine what the problem is, and hopefully help you figure out a
  solution.


[[no_build_available]]
== No build available to download

Installing an iOS app on a particular device requires that the app is
properly signed. If you have not yet uploaded a
link:../../deployments/ios/code_signing/README.adoc[code signing
certificate], buddybuild cannot properly sign your application.

This means that a successful build cannot be installed on a device, and
so buddybuild **does not make the build artifact available for
download**.

This situation does not prevent your tests from running; instead of
performing a _device_ build, buddybuild performs a _simulator_ build
that your tests can use.

{% include "/_common/note-device_vs_simulator_builds.adoc" %}


[[will_not_install]]
== Build will not install on a device

Almost every case of an app not installing on a device is caused by an
existing version of the app already installed conflicting with
buddybuild's attempt to install it.

In particular, buddybuild **cannot install on top of an App Store
version**. Please delete any App Store versions before attempting to
install an app through buddybuild.

Also, when there are pending (or active) iOS updates, it appears that
app installs are blocked. Make sure that your device is fully updated
before attempting an app install.


[[unable_to_download]]
== "Unable to Download App" message

This error is quite generic and could be caused by the following
reasons, but not limited to:

- The device's UDID is not included in the provisioning profile.

- The build was incorrectly signed or has broken entitlements.

- The device or iOS version is incompatible with the build.

- The device's storage is full.

- You've reached your device provisioning limit in your Apple Developer
  Account (See your "Remaining devices" in your **App Settings >
  Integrations > Apple Developer Portal**, in the
  link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild dashboard]).

Sometimes a "Rebuild without cache" might get you going, but if you are
still experiencing this, we recommend that you
link:getting_device_logs_from_xcode.adoc[get the device logs] and reach
out to us on Intercom.


[[private_browsing]]
== Private browsing

Installation of an app build from buddybuild does not work when Private
browsing mode is enabled in Safari.

Private browsing mode protects your privacy by not collecting or storing
certain kinds of personal information, and blocks certain kinds of
tracking. Buddybuild's app installation process requires some of the
tracking that Private browsing mode blocks.

Here's how to turn off Private browsing:

. Tap the tabs button (the right-most button in the bottom toolbar below)
+
image:img/screen-ios-safari-private_browsing.png["Buddybuild's Private Browsing
error page, as displayed on an iPhone", 621, 1076, role="half"]

. Tap on **Private** to deselect it.

. Quit Safari, then click on the install link again.

If you still see this error message, make sure cookies are not disabled
on your device:

. Tap **Block Cookies**.
. Make sure that **Always Block** is _not_ set.

. Open the **Settings** app.
. Tap **Safari**.
. Make sure that **Block All Cookies** is _not_ set.

[[nothing_happens]]
== Nothing happens when trying to register the device or to install the app

This issue is caused when opening the link in a
**SFSafariViewController** (a stripped down version of Safari in third
party apps) and not **Safari**, the main app itself.

The issue can be fixed by forcing the link to open in Safari. Then to
install from Safari:

screen as displayed on an iPhone, with the 'Install Profile' popup
displayed", 621, 1072, role="half"]


[[profile_failed]]
== Profile installation Failed: Couldn't communicate with a helper application

When you get this error while trying to install the buddybuild profile,
try the following:

. Open the Settings app.

. Tap **General**.

. Tap **Profile**.

. Tap **buddybuild.com Config**.

. Tap **Remove Profile**.

. Enter your passcode.

. Tap **Remove**.

. Visit https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/reset

. Try to reinstall the build, buddybuild should ask you to install the
  profile again.
