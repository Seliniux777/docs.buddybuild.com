= Common React Native errors

Weâ€™ve put together a quick checklist to help teams troubleshoot the most
common causes for build failures.

Here's what you can to do quickly diagnose and likely resolve build
errors:

- <<error1>>
- <<error2>>
- <<error3>>

[[error1]]
== Clone your repo and check if your app builds locally

It's important to make sure there are no discrepancies between your
remote branch and local git state.

Buddybuild creates a fresh clone of your code and executes build
commands on every commit.

Here's how to replicate this process and ensure your remote branch is up
to date:

- Clone your repo into a new location / folder on your machine

- **Make sure that the node version installed on your machine is what's
  being used on buddybuild**

- Do a fresh npm install and attempt to build your app


[[error2]]
== Double check your third party dependencies

=== Node

- Make sure that the node version you are using locally is the same as
  what's being used to build the branch you're having issues with.

- A frequently seen issue is a `package.json` that specifies
  non-explicit versions of package dependencies (i.e. using carets `^`
  and tildes `~`). This might result in failed builds because different
  versions of dependencies are being installed on buddybuild than what
  is being used on your local machine. Our recommendation is to either
  remove these characters or to move to using yarn, which has a
  corresponding yarn.lock that specifies the exact versions you're using
  locally.

=== Gradle

Bear in mind that even if you have your npm dependencies locked down,
those npm dependencies might have Gradle files that use wildcards to
reference their dependencies.

Those dependency versions are **NOT** locked down and might result in
issues when building on buddybuild.

For example:

[[code-samples]]
--
.Wildcard Dependency
[source,groovy]
----
compile('com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:4.+')
----
--

[[error3]]
== Make sure your app is configured to generate an offline bundle

An offline bundle is required for CI systems to pack the relevant
Javascript code into your app, as there's no development server around
to share javascript code.

For Android, you will notice at the top of your app/build.gradle file a
commented auto-generated block that indicates how to generate an offline
bundle for a given variant. By default, offline bundles are disabled for
debug/development variants.

The code below provides an example as to how to generate an offline
bundle for a debug variant.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,groovy]
----
project.ext.react = [
        // whether to bundle JavaScript and assets in staging mode
        bundleInDebug: true,
        jsBundleDirDebug: "$buildDir/intermediates/assets/debug"
]

apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native/react.gradle"
----
--

== Troubleshooting Errors

=== Unable to resolve module <module name> from <path>: Module does not exist in the module map or in these directories:

We've found that this error is generally caused by using wildcards (`^` or
`~`) in your `package.json`.

Our recommendation is to either remove the wildcards, or to move to
using yarn and committing your yarn.lock.

=== Could not get BatchedBridge, make sure your bundle is packaged properly

This indicates that your app is not correctly configured to generate
offline bundles, which is required for apps generated using continuous
integration systems like buddybuild.

Look to <<error3>> as to how to configure your app to resolve this.

=== error: package <name> does not exist

This is generally caused by two different issues.

. Your `settings.gradle` path references to React Native modules might
  be invalid.

. You've upgraded to a buildToolsVersion that one of your React Native
  dependencies does not support. For example, if you were to upgrade to
  buildToolsVersion 25.0.0, that mandates that all your application's
  dependencies must also be at least at that buildToolsVersion. If a
  dependency does not satisfy that requirement, gradle will silently
  ignore the dependency and you'll get import errors.
+
This can be fixed by adding something like this to your root level
`build.gradle` file:
+
[source,groovy]
----
subprojects {
  ext {
    buildTools = "25.0.1"
  }
  afterEvaluate { project ->
    println project.name
    if (project.name.indexOf('react-native-code-push') > -1 && project.hasProperty("android")) {
      android {
        buildToolsVersion buildTools
      }
    }
  }
}
----

=== fatal error: `React/RCTViewManager.h` file not found

This generally indicates that you are using a buddybuild-generated scheme
that is not correctly adding `libReact.a` as a target dependency.

In these instances, we recommend that you share your scheme and configure your app
to use your shared scheme rather than buddybuild's generated scheme.
See link:../ios/missing_schemes.adoc[Missing schemes] for details.

=== error: `FBSDKShareKit/FBSDKShareKit.h` file not found

This is generally a result of an incorrectly configured repository with
regards to the location of FBSDK dependencies.

If you take a look at:
https://github.com/facebook/react-native-fbsdk/blob/master/ios/RCTFBSDK.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj

You will notice that RCTFBSDK will look for dependencies in one of two
locations:

- `~/Documents/FacebookSDK`

- `$(PROJECT_DIR)/../../../ios/Frameworks`

The second option is the correct option for continuous integration
systems like buddybuild.

In other words, you MUST place your FBSDK dependencies under the
"ios/Frameworks" folder in order for it to work on a continuous
integration system.


=== React Native packager is stalling during an Android build

If you're stuck at "mergeReleaseResources" or
"bundleReleaseJsAndAssets", one reason we've found this to be the case
is that there are realm auxiliary artifacts lying around in one of your
directories that the React Native package is attempting to
traverse/parse.

In particular `default.realm.*` files or a `realm-object-server`
directory. More often that not, we've found these artifacts to be
generated by some test framework (i.e. jest).
https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#auxiliary-realm-files


=== /node_modules/react-native-fbsdk/android/build/intermediates/res/merged/release/values-v24/values-v24.xml:3: AAPT: Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'android:TextAppearance.Material.Widget.Button.Borderless.Colored'.

This generally is a result of version mismatches. The
`react-native-fbsdk` node module uses wildcards in its gradle file to
reference its `facebook-android-sdk` version dependency, and depending
on the version picked up, it can cause failures.
