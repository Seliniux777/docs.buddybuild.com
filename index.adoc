.Continuous deployment & instant delivery
--
Choose to deploy your app with every build, or on a schedule that works
for you and your team -- no review process needed. For iOS developers,
the headaches of dealing with code signing, provisioning profiles and
testers’ devices are over. Beta testers and stakeholders get a
streamlined, "one click" install experience as buddybuild manages
provisioning profiles and devices for you. Then, when you’re ready, use
buddybuild to submit directly to the App Store and Play Store.

physical devices if needed; Prepare your app for beta testing or
