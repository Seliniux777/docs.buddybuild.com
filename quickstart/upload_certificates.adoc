= Upload your iOS certificates

Before we can invite testers to test your app, buddybuild requires
your link:{{readme.path}}/deployments/code_signing/README.adoc[Code
Signing Identities and Provisioning Profiles] to create signed device
builds.

All apps to be installed on devices must be signed with a code-signing
identity. Buddybuild cannot create a code-signing identity for you, you
need to do that through Xcode, or the Apple Developer Portal. For more
information, see
link:https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingCertificates/MaintainingCertificates.html[Maintaining
Your Signing Identities and Certificates] in Apple's documentation.

Finding and uploading specific items from your keychain can be painful
and confusing. We have automated the entire process, but you can
continue with the manual process if you prefer. The following steps
describe the automated process:

. After you link:apple_developer_portal.adoc[Connect to the Apple
  Developer Portal], the **Upload Certificates** screen is displayed:

screen", 1280, 581, role="frame"]

[TIP]
=====
**Prefer the manual way?**

Manually upload your certificates from your keychain by clicking on
**The Manual Way** tab.

Follow the guide
link:{{readme.path}}/deployments/code_signing/upload_manually.adoc[here]
if you have any trouble.

  Click the clipboard button, to the right of the `curl` command
  example. The `curl` command example is copied to the clipboard.

. Open the **Terminal** application, paste the command into the
  **Terminal** window, and press **Return**.

You should be prompted for a password to access the keychain containing
the certificates:
+
image:img/dialog-cert_upload-keychain_access.png["The password dialog for
access to the certificate keychain", 436, 219, role="frame"]
+
This `curl` script automatically exports certificates and provisioning
profiles that are required for creating signed builds of your app. We've
already analyzed your project during your first build -- and so we only
pull what you need to build your project and nothing more.

In your browser, the **Code signing is set up!** screen is displayed:
+

. image:img/button-invite_testers.png["The Invite testers button", 112,
  42, role="right"]
  Click the **Invite testers** button to continue with
  link:invite_testers.adoc[Invite testers to try your app].

{% include "/_common/note-device_vs_simulator_builds.adoc" %}

Once the upload is complete, buddybuild has everything it needs to
perform device builds. Now all we need is a set of emails to send these
builds to -- continue with link:invite_testers.adoc[Invite testers to
try your app].
