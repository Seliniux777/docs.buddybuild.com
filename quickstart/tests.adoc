Buddybuild supports unit tests right out of the box, for iOS, tvOS,
and watchOS. Here's how to set them up:

. Log in to the link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild
  dashboard]. The list of builds is displayed:
+

role="frame"]

. image:{{readme.path}}/_img/button-gear.png["The gear button", 38, 32,
  role="right"]
  Click the **gear** button to the right of a build. The **Build
  configuration** screen is displayed:

screen", 1280, 737, role="frame"]

. image:img/button-test_settings.png["The Test settings button", 240,
  42, role="right"]
  In the left-hand navigation panel, click the **Test settings** button.
  The **Test configuration** screen is displayed:

The options available are:

role="right"]
Click the **Configure** button to access the **Run tests** screen.

Buddybuild maintains a pool of simulators of Apple devices, with a
selection of iOS versions. You can select which simulators to use when
running your UI tests.
+
On this screen, you can:

. Enable or disable all simulator testing. To do so, click
the **Run tests** toggle.

. image:img/tooltip-device_limit.png["The device limit tooltip", 200,
  119, role="right"]
  Select which simulators to use for UI testing.
+
Buddybuild plans have limits on the number of simulators that can be
used for each build. If you try to enable more simulators than the
number supported by your plan, a tooltip appears warning you of the
limitation.
****

role="right"]
When you are done, click the **`X`** button, at the top right of the
screen, to return to the **Test configuration** screen.

- **Only run Tests**
+
When you have at least one simulator selected in <<run_tests,**Run
Tests**>>, the **Only run Tests** option is available. Once enabled,
**Only run Tests** results in a build that is only used for tests; no
IPA is created, so deployment to testers or to the App store is not
possible.

[NOTE]
======
When you make changes to the test configuration, you need to kick off a
new build before you can see the effect of the changes. Either click
**Build Now** or push a new change to your app's repository to start a
new build.

Once your tests have run, click on a specific build to view the **Build
details** screen. Alongside the **Details** and **Logs** tabs, there are
one or more tabs for each kind of test run during the build:
