= Disconnect single sign-on (SSO) provider

If you want to stop using SSO, you need to disconnect the connection to
the identity provider (IDP). You can make SSO logins non-functional by
disabling or deleting the application in the IDP interface, but
buddybuild would not allow your users to login (it would try and fail to
authenticate with the IDP).

To disconnect the SSO connection:

. Log in to the link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild
  dashboard].

  organizations that you currently belong to.

[IMPORTANT]
===========
When you disconnect the SSO connection, all users connected with SSO
logins are immediately disconnected, and their SSO logins no longer
work.

That's it!
