= Require single sign-on (SSO) logins

If you prefer that your users only use SSO, you can enable **Require
SSO**, which prevents users from logging in from an enterprise email
domain, or accessing applications associated with your SSO organization
in buddybuild.

[IMPORTANT]
===========
When you enable **Require SSO logins**, any connected users that are not
logged in via the IDP are immediately disconnected. They need to log in
again using SSO.
===========

To require SSO logins, follow these steps:

. Log in to the link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild
  dashboard].

. image:../../_img/dropdown-user-manage_org.png["Select Manage Org in
  the avatar dropdown", 121, 207, role="right"]
  Move your mouse pointer over your avatar in the top right corner. A
  dropdown menu appears.

. Select **Manage Org**. The **Manage Organization** screen appears:

organization", 206, 40, role="right"]
  In the left navigation, a dropdown menu exists with the current
  organization selected. Click the dropdown menu to list all of the
  organizations that you currently belong to.

. Select the organization that needs SSO configuration.

. image:../../_img/panel-organization_settings.png["The Organization
  Settings panel", 206, 200, role="right"]
  On the left side of the screen, find the **Organization Settings**
  links. Click **Single sign-on (SSO)**. The **SSO settings** screen is
  displayed:

  dialog is displayed:

  button", 260, 42, role="right"]
  Click the **Require SSO logins** button. The **SSO settings** screen
  is displayed.

[CAUTION]
=========
You may be logged out of the dashboard when Require SSO logins is
enabled. If your SSO configuration is not working, for example if the
application at your IDP is disabled or deleted, you may have to contact
buddybuild to regain access.
=========

That's it!
