= Signing up with Bitbucket

First things first! Let's sign up with buddybuild.

Signing up with buddybuild via Bitbucket allows buddybuild to access
your iOS apps' source code. Buddybuild associates with
your repository, and builds your app every time a commit is pushed by
you or your team -- ensuring that you always have a green build that you
can deploy to your testers.

[NOTE]
======
**Using Beanstalk, Gitolite, TFS or any other git server?**

Follow the instructions link:ssh.adoc[here] to get started.
======

[CAUTION]
====
Buddybuild rejects connecting to repositories via HTTPS that are
provisioned with self-signed certificates.

Using a self-signed certificate could make it possible for someone to
spoof your repository and inject malicious code into your builds.
====

== Step 1: Signing up with an existing service

Let's get started by visiting the
link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/signup[Sign up page].

Simply click on the **Bitbucket** button to sign up with your credentials.
