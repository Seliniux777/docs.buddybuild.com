= Connect with GitHub Enterprise

Connecting with GitHub Enterprise grants buddybuild access to your
repository so that it can build your app when you push code to your
repository. Connecting also grants buddybuild API access to manage
webhooks for you, generate commit status, integrate with the GitHub
issue tracker, enables the pull request flow, synchronizes access
control for team management and more.

Each member of your team that uses buddybuild should go through this
guide to connect with GitHub Enterprise. This is encouraged so that you
can take advantage of team management features.

[CAUTION]
====
Buddybuild rejects connecting to repositories via HTTPS that are
provisioned with self-signed certificates.

Using a self-signed certificate could make it possible for someone to
spoof your repository and inject malicious code into your builds.

== Connection steps

. If you have not already done so,
  link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/signup[sign up for a buddybuild
  account].

. Visit this link:
  https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/apps/wizard/build/select-source

The **Where is your source code?** screen is displayed:

Enterprise** screen is displayed:

image:img/screen-connect_with_ghe.png["The Connect with GitHub
Enterprise screen", 1280, 310, role="frame"]

. Specify the hostname for your GitHub Enterprise instance. If your
instance uses a non-default HTTPS port, include the port. For example
`ghe.mycompany.com:1234`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
===========
Your GitHub Enterprise instance needs to be publicly accessible. If
necessary, adjust your firewall configuration to allow the buddybuild
fleet of build servers to access your instance. See
link:../repository/self_hosted.adoc[Self-hosted repositories] for
details.

Also, if you use private DNS for your instance, use the IP address of
the server instead of the hostname.
