Buddybuild supports unit tests right out of the box, for iOS (and tvOS
and watchOS) and Android. Here's how to set them up:

. Log in to the link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild
  dashboard]. The list of builds is displayed:

role="frame"]

. image:{{readme.path}}/_img/button-gear.png["The gear button", 38, 32,
  role="right"]
  Click the **gear** button to the right of a build. The **Build
  configuration** screen is displayed:

screen", 1280, 737, role="frame"]

. image:img/button-test_settings.png["The Test settings button", 240,
  42, role="right"]
  In the left-hand navigation panel, click the **Test settings** button.
  The **Test configuration** screen is displayed, which varies for
  link:ios.adoc[iOS] and link:android.adoc[Android] apps.

[NOTE]
======
When you make changes to the test configuration, you need to kick off a
new build before you can see the effect of the changes. Either click
**Build Now** or push a new change to your app's repository to start a
new build.

Once your tests have run, click on a specific build to view the **Build
details** screen. Alongside the **Details** and **Logs** tabs, there are
one or more tabs for each kind of test run during the build:
