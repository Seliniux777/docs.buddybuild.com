Buddybuild maintains a pool of mobile Android devices from various
manufacturers, with a selection of Android versions. You can select
which devices to use when running your UI tests, which gives you greater
confidence that your app works correctly than using simulator tests.

On this screen, you can:

--

. Enable or disable all UI testing on physical devices. To do so, click
the **UI tests on physical devices** toggle.

for each build. If you try to enable more devices than the number
supported by your plan, a tooltip appears warning you of the limitation.

== Treat Android UI tests as warnings

Normally, when your UI tests fail, your build is also marked as failed.
Failed builds cannot be deployed to testers. Use this setting to mark
builds as successful and make them deployable, even when your UI tests
fail.
