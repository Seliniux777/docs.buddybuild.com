Buddybuild maintains a pool of simulators of Apple devices, with a
selection of iOS versions. You can select which simulators to use when
running your UI tests.

On this screen, you can:

. Enable or disable all simulator testing. To do so, click
the **Run tests** toggle.

  Select which simulators to use for UI testing.

Buddybuild plans have limits on the number of simulators that can be
used for each build. If you try to enable more simulators than the
number supported by your plan, a tooltip appears warning you of the
limitation.

When you are done, click the **`X`** button, at the top right of the
screen, to return to the **Test configuration** screen.


== Only run Tests

When you have at least one simulator selected in <<runtests>>, the
**Only run Tests** option is available. Once enabled, **Only run Tests**
causes the build to create an executable, which is only used for tests;
no IPA is created, so deployment to testers or to the App store is not
possible.
