= Sign up with GitHub

When you sign up to buddybuild via GitHub, you allow buddybuild to
access your app's source code. Buddybuild associates with your
repository and builds your app every time a commit is pushed, by you or
your team. This ensures that you always have a green build that you can
deploy to your testers.

start typing the name of a repository; matching repositories appear
