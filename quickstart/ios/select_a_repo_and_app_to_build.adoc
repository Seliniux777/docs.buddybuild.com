= Selecting an App

Now that we've connected with to your source control system, you'll need
to select the repository containing your iOS App.

link:../github.adoc[Sign up with buddybuild] if you haven't done so
already.

After signing up, buddybuild presents you with a list of repositories
you have access to. Simply choose the one you want to build.

[NOTE]
======
**One target per app**

Each buddybuild app maps to a single target in your Xcode project.
You'll need to follow this process for each target you'd like to build.

Buddybuild pulls down your source code and analyzes the repo for apps.

If we find multiple Apps, you'll be prompted to select one. If you have
a single app, it'll be automatically detected and buddybuild will kick
off a build!

That's it! You've just created a build of your app in buddybuild.
Proceed to the next step to link:invite_testers.adoc[invite testers] to
