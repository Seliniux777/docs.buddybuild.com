= Select a repository and app to build

Now that we've connected with your source control account, you need to
select the repository containing your app.

. link:connect/README.adoc[Sign up with buddybuild] if you haven't
  done so already.

. Once you have connected buddybuild to your source code provider, the
  **Add an app** screen appears:
+
image:img/screen-add_an_app.png["The Add an app screen", 1280, 480,
role="frame"]

. Select a repository containing the app you want buddybuild to build by
clicking the circle to the left of the repository name. The repository
becomes highlighted:
+
image:img/panel-selected_app.png["A selected app is highlighted", 841,
53]
+
If multiple apps exist in your repository, you need to select which one
to build; **each platform (iOS, tvOS, watchOS, or Android) and build
target must be added to buddybuild as a separate app**. If you have a
single app, it is automatically detected and buddybuild kick offs a
build.

. image:img/button-add_app.png["The Add app button", 72, 30,
  role="right"]
  Click the **Add app** button. The **Preparing to build your app...**
  screen appears:
+
image:img/screen-preparing-securing.png["The Preparing to build your
app... screen, securing a build environment", 1280, 450, role="frame"]
+
Once the build environment has been secured, buddybuild retrieves your
source code:
+
image:img/screen-preparing-retrieving.png["The Preparing to build your
app... screen, retrieving your source code", 1280, 447, role="frame"]
+
Once your source code has been retrieved, buddybuild analyzes your
source code to determine the optimal settings for the build:
+
image:img/screen-preparing-scanning.png["The Preparing to build your
app...  screen, scanning your source code", 1280, 450, role="frame"]
+
Once the analysis completes, buddybuild starts to build your app:
+
image:img/screen-building_app.png["Creating a build of your app screen",
1280, 703, role="frame"]
+
Finally, when the build is complete, the build completion screen is
displayed:
+
image:img/screen-build_success.png["The build success screen", 1280,
478, role="frame"]
+
Buddybuild also sends you an email to let you know about the build status:
+
image:img/screen-email-build_success.png["The build status email
message", 651, 690, role="frame"]
+
When you open the email message on your mobile device, tapping the
**Take me to the build** button initiates installation of the app.

That's it! You've built your app with buddybuild.
See how easy that was? There is just one more simple step -- **integrate
the buddybuild SDK, for link:ios/integrate_sdk.adoc[iOS] or
link:android/integrate_sdk.adoc[Android], into your app**.
