titletext: Invite testers to try your app
description: >
  Buddybuild manages code signing and provisioning profiles complexities to
  create signed device builds, allowing you to send apps to testers easily.
---
= Connect to the Apple Developer Portal

It can also be painful and confusing to managing device universal
identifiers (UDIDs) and your provisioning profiles. Once your Apple
Developer Portal connection is set up, buddybuild automatically manages
those changes on your behalf, any time you make changes to your roster
of testers.

If you have not done so already, link:connect/README.adoc[Sign up and
connect buddybuild to your source control] and then
link:select.adoc[Select a repository/app to build].

. After you link:select.adoc[add an app to buddybuild], you should
  see the **Ready to try on a device** dialog:
