pass:[<i class="fa fa-android fa-3x right"></i>]
Integrating the buddybuild SDK for Android requires no code changes.
Enabling the SDK is as simple as clicking a button.

[IMPORTANT]
===========
**What's the minimum API version supported?**

android:minSdkVersion="19"

**What version of the Android SDK does buddybuild target?**

android:targetSdkVersion="21"

Example `build.gradle` configuration:

[source,gradle]
----
android {
    compileSdkVersion 21
    buildToolsVersion '21.1.2'

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 19
        targetSdkVersion 21
    }
}

== Step 1: Configure SDK Installation

On your App's page, under the **Feedback** tab, click on the **Try the
buddybuild SDK** button.

== Step 2: Enable the SDK

Enable the SDK in whatever branch you'd like. Typically, the SDK will be
used by your testers, so you'll want to enable the SDK on the branches
that deploy to your testers.

That's it! A new build is kicked off with the SDK enabled. Install this
build on your device. Open your app and shake your device. See what
happens!

You're all set now to deploy your app broadly to all your testers and to
receive graphically annotated feedback from them!
