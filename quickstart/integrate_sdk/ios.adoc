pass:[<i class="fa fa-apple fa-3x right"></i>]
Enabling the SDK requires code changes in your iOS Application. We can
make these changes automatically so you don't have to! You can enable
the buddybuild SDK in just two easy steps.

[NOTE]
======
**File size of the buddybuild SDK**

Integrating the buddybuild SDK will increase the size of the resulting
`.ipa` by less than 1 MB.

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Configure SDK Installation

On your app's page, under the **Feedback** tab, click on the **Try the
buddybuild SDK** button.

yet installed", 1500, 792]


[[step2]]
== Step 2: Install the SDK

Install the SDK in whatever branch you'd like. Typically, the SDK is
used by your testers, so install the SDK on the branches that deploy to
your testers.

That's it! A new build will be kicked off with the SDK enabled. Install
this build on your device. Open your app and take a screenshot -- and
see what happens!

You're all set now to deploy your app broadly to all your testers. There
is just one more thing.

Typically, development and testing devices need to be manually added to
your provisioning profiles before they will accept deployed builds. This
requires app developers to acquire the UDID (the device unique id) of
the testing devices from the testers and then add them to the
provisioning profiles used to build the app. This process is manual and
is the source of a lot of headache for developers.

We've automated this process as well. Buddybuild can acquire UDIDs of
your testers' devices, add them to your provisioning profiles completely
automatically and transparently.

To enable this, connect your link:apple_developer_portal_sync.adoc[Apple
Developer account] with buddybuild.

Guide].

[[update]]
== Update the SDK

. Open the Terminal and `cd` to your root directory of your repo.

. Run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
curl -Ls http://tools.buddybuild.com.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/UpdateSDK | sh

. Commit and push the changes.

[[uninstall]]
=== Uninstall the SDK

If for some reason, you wish to uninstall the SDK, you simply need to
revert the commit which installed it in the first place.
