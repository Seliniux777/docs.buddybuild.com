== About the buddybuild SDK

pass:[<i class="fa fa-android fa-3x right"></i>]
The buddybuild SDK is a lightweight yet powerful suite of tools that
integrates seamlessly into your application. The SDK includes a
graphical feedback reporter, a crash reporting and analysis tool,
automatic app updating and usage tracking. The SDK is regularly updated
with new features.

The buddybuild SDK is available for both
link:../android/integrate_sdk.adoc[iOS] and Android platforms and
enables the following features:

[IMPORTANT]
===========
**What's the minimum API version supported?**

android:minSdkVersion="19"


**What version of the Android SDK does buddybuild target?**

android:targetSdkVersion="21"

Example `build.gradle` configuration:

[source,gradle]
----
android {
    compileSdkVersion 21
    buildToolsVersion '21.1.2'

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 19
        targetSdkVersion 21
    }
}

=== Feedback Reporter

With buddybuild, you simply shake the device to share feedback. Our
feedback reporter sends graphically annotated screenshots, feedback
notes and device metadata to your team. Integrate with GitHub, JIRA and
Pivotal Tracker to track feedback as issues.

=== Automatic Update

Receiving feedback on old builds is pointless - you've probably already
fixed the issue you've received feedback on! It is crucial to keep your
testers and beta users updated on the very latest builds. If a newer
build is available, the buddybuild SDK can automatically prompt to
install the latest version of your app.
link:{{readme.path}}/sdk/automatic_update.adoc[Learn more.]


=== Usage Tracking

Know when your testers download and launch your app in real time.
Identify who tested your app, when they launched it and what version
they tested. Correlate this with feedback and crash reports to
understand your customers' experience.

== How to install

Integrating the buddybuild SDK into your Android app requires no code
changes, and requires only a few steps:

. Log in to the link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild
  dashboard]. The list of builds is displayed:
+
image:../img/screen-builds.png["The list of builds", 1280, 300,
role="frame"]

. image:../img/button-feedback.png["The Feedback button", 98, 64,
  role="right"]
  Click the **Feedback** button in the top navigation bar. The
  **Feedback** screen is displayed:

role="frame"]

. image:../img/button-install_the_sdk.png["The Install the SDK button",
  152, 42, role="right"]
  Click the **Install the SDK** button. The **Install the SDK** screen
  is displayed:
+
image:../img/screen-install_sdk.png["The Install the SDK screen", 1280,
579, role="frame"]

. image:../img/button-install.png["The Install button", 57, 30,
  role="right"]
  Click the **Install** button beside each branch that should have the
  buddybuild SDK integrated. Typically, the SDK is used by your testers,
  so install the SDK on the branches that deploy to your testers.
+
The branch's entry in the list is replaced with a notice indicating that
a new build has been started:
+
image:../img/panel-build_kicked_off.png["The build kicked off panel", 728,
132]

That's it! A new build is kicked off with the SDK enabled. Install this
build on your device. Open your app and shake your device. See what
happens!

You're all set now to deploy your app broadly to all
link:invite_testers.adoc[your testers] and to receive graphically
annotated feedback from them!
