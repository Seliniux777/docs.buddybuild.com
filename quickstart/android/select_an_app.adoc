= Selecting an Android app from the repository

Now that we've connected with your Source Control account, you'll need
to point to the Repo containing your Android App.

link:../github.adoc[Sign up with buddybuild] if you haven't done so
already.

After signing up, buddybuild will present you with a list of
repositories you have access to. Simply choose the one you want to
build.

Buddybuild will pull down your source code and analyze the repo for
apps.

If we find multiple Apps, you'll be prompted to select one. If you have
a single app, it'll be automatically detected and buddybuild will kick
off a build!

The build should finish in a few seconds. Next, click on **Go to the
Dashboard**.

That's it! You've built your app with buddybuild. You will receive an
email containing a link to install the build of your App. Open this
email on your phone to try out the build you've just created.

See how easy that was? There is just one more simple step --
