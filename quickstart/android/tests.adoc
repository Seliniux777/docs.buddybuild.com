Buddybuild maintains a pool of mobile Android devices from various
manufacturers, with a selection of Android versions. You can select
which devices to use when running your UI tests, which gives you greater
confidence that your app works correctly than using simulator tests.

for each build. If you try to enable more devices than the number
supported by your plan, a tooltip appears warning you of the limitation.

fail.

[NOTE]
======
When you make changes to the test configuration, you need to kick off a
new build before you can see the effect of the changes. Either click
**Build Now** or push a new change to your app's repository to start a
new build.

Once your tests have run, click on a specific build to view the **Build
details** screen. Alongside the **Details** and **Logs** tabs, there are
one or more tabs for each kind of test run during the build:
