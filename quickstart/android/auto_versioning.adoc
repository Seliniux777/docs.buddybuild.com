= Auto versioning Android builds

== VersionCode

Buddybuild can update the `VersionCode` automatically for you. The process
is done on the fly, does not require write access to the repo, and no
changes will be committed back to the repo.

All you need to do is to turn on **Auto-Versioning** in the settings.

== VersionName

The best practice is to update VersionName in the `build.gradle`, and
Buddybuild simply respects that.

[NOTE]
======
We do not recommend using the output from `git describe --tags` to
inform the value of `VersionName`.

For performance reasons, buddybuild downloads only the minimal set of
branches and commits from the repository. Often this means that
buddybuild downloads only the HEAD commit for a single branch. As such,
there may be insufficient information available from the repository to
automatically set `VersionName`.
======

One idea is to make use of the environment variables listed here:
