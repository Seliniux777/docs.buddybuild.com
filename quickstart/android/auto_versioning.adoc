= Auto-versioning Android builds

Android builds use two settings for build versions:

- <<version_name,`VersionName`>> (`android:versionName`) is a string that
  represents the _friendly_ version identifier that your users see. This
  could be based on link:http://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning],
  elements in the link:https://www.ptable.com/[periodic table], or a
  member of an link:http://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp[animal
  menagerie].

- <<version_code,`VersionCode`>> (`android:versionCode`) is an integer
  value that is used to distinguish _each build_. Android uses this
  value to determine whether the latest version is installed.
+
Common practice is to assign large numeric ranges to each kind of
release you plan to deploy. For example, you might decide that
100,000-500,000 represents the range for beta releases, and
1,000,000-2,000,000 represents the range for stable releases. It's
important to note that the Google Play Developer Console won't let you
update to a build with a lower `VersionCode` value.


[[version_code]]
== VersionCode

Buddybuild can update the `VersionCode` automatically for you. The process
is done on the fly, does not require write access to the repo, and no
changes will be committed back to the repo.

All you need to do is to turn on **Auto-Versioning** in the settings.

[[version_name]]
== VersionName

The best practice is to update `VersionName` in the `build.gradle`, and
Buddybuild simply respects that.

[NOTE]
======
We do not recommend using the output from `git describe --tags` to
inform the value of `VersionName`.

For performance reasons, buddybuild downloads only the minimal set of
branches and commits from the repository. Often this means that
buddybuild downloads only the HEAD commit for a single branch. As such,
there may be insufficient information available from the repository to
automatically set `VersionName`.

Buddybuild recommends manually specifying the `VersionName`, using
link:http://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning] and this template:

[source,text]

versionName = major.minor.versionCode

One idea is to make use of the environment variables listed here:
