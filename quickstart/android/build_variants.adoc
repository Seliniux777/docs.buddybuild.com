== Choose the variants to build for a specific branch

You can also select variants to build for a specific branch by creating
a **branch-specific override**.

First, click **Add new branch**, then select the branch you would like
to override.

**Product Flavors**

If your project has Product Flavors, buddybuild displays them in the
variants section. In the case of the screenshots above, **"production"**
and **"staging"** are the product's Flavors.
