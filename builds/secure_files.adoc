= Secure Files

You might have API keys and other secrets that your app needs to consume
-- either at run time or during a build. However, you might not want to
check these secrets into your source code to make them available to your
app.

In order to securely propagate your credentials to your build and app,
buddybuild provides three sets of variables that you can define:

. link:environment_variables.adoc[Environment Variables] (made available
  to your build time scripts)

. link:device_variables_1.adoc#step1[Device Variables] (available your
  App at run time via the buddybuild SDK)

. Secure Files (files made available to your build time scripts)

Let's get started with Secure Files!

== Step 1: Upload a Secure File to buddybuild

Launch the buddybuild dashboard and select **App Settings**.

In the left navigation, select **Build settings**, then **Secure
files**.

1500, 800]

Select the file you would like to upload and select **Upload file**

1500, 729]

Your file is now ready to be consumed by your app.


== Step 2: Consume the secure file in your build

Your secure files are automatically consumed by tools that are expecting
them.


== 2a. Consume in your custom build scripts.

If you would like to access them in your
link:custom_build_steps.adoc[custom build scripts], use
the bash variable expansion syntax.

[source,bash]
----
./Example.framework/run ${BUDDYBUILD_SECURE_FILES}/file.txt
----


== 2b. Consume in Android `build.gradle` file.

If you are building an **Android** app with **Gradle** (Android Studio),
you can also access them 2 ways inside your `build.gradle` file.

You can access them via `System.getenv()`, like this:

[source,json]
----
signing.keyId=1234567
signing.password=secret
signing.secretKeyRingFile= new File(System.getenv("BUDDYBUILD_SECURE_FILES") + "/secring.gpg")
----

That's it! For more details, refer to our link:../sdk/api.adoc[SDK API
guide].
