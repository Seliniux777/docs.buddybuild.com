= Skipping a Build

If you donâ€™t want to build a particular commit just add `[ci skip]` to
the commit message.

[source,bash]
git commit --message='[ci skip] Fix typo in README'

A build will not be created if buddybuild finds `[ci skip]` anywhere in
the commit message of the head commit. You can use the **Build Now**
button on the Builds page to build the tip of a branch if you decide
that you want to run the build after all!

[TIP]
=====
Do you want to avoid builds when select files are committed? Check out
link:selective_builds.adoc[Selective builds].

== Skipping all pull request builds

If you don't want to build any builds associated with a pull request,
then add `[ci skip]` to the pull request title. This is more convenient
than adding `[ci skip]` to every commit in the pull request.

== Variations

The order and case of the keywords is not important, meaning that you
can also say `[CI SKIP]`, `[skip ci]`, `[skip CI]` and so on.
