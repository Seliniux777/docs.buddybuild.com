= Danger

link:https://github.com/danger/danger[Danger] is a tool that runs as
part of your continuous integration process. Using a domain-specific
language, it lets you define any arbitrary set of rules that suit your
teamâ€™s pull request code review practices. For example: checking that
the pull request might have modified some sensitive files and that the
whole pull request needs to be carefully reviewed.

[NOTE]
======
There are two versions of Danger, one implemented in Ruby and the other
in http://danger.systems/js/[JavaScript]. This section only covers the
Ruby implementation.
======

This section contains several sub-sections:

- <<install>>
- <<configure>>
- <<examples>>
** <<lint>>
** <<coverage>>
** <<relnotes>>


[[install]]
== Install

Installing Danger is easy. You can use the
link:http://danger.systems/guides/getting_started.html[Danger
documentation], but the few commands required are:

[source,bash]
----
gem install bundler
bundle init
echo "gem 'danger', '~> 5.5', '>= 5.5.3'" >> Gemfile
bundle install
bundle exec danger --version # "5.5.3"
----

These commands ensure that Bundler, the Ruby dependency manager, is
installed and configured, that Danger is added as a dependency to
your `Gemfile`, and that Danger is installed. Finally, Danger is
executed to demonstrate that is has been installed successfully.


[[configure]]
== Configure

Danger has a built-in configuration process, but there is also some
configuration required in the buddybuild dashboard:

. (Optional) Create a branch for including Danger in your project.
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout -b setup-danger
----

. Create the initial Danger configuration.
+
[source,bash]
----
danger init
----
+
This process is interactive, and includes:
+
- Creation of the Danger configuration file `Dangerfile`
- Asking you to setup a Danger-specific GitHub account
- Asking you to create a personal access token
- Asking you to add Danger to your CI system.
- Asking you to expose the personal access token via environment
  variables.

. Add the Danger access token as an environment variable.

. Log in to the link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild
  dashboard]

. In the top navigation bar, select the app that should include Danger.

. In the top navigation bar, click **App Settings**. The screen is
displayed:

691, role="frame"]

. image:img/tab-environment.png["The Environment tab", 137, 53,
  role="right"]
  Click the **Environment** tab. The **Environment** settings are
  displayed:
+
image:img/screen-environment_settings.png["The Default build
configuration screen, with the Environment tab selected", 1280, 619]

. image:img/button-configure.png["The Configure button", 81, 30,
  role="right"]
  In the **Environment variables** row, click the **Configure** button.
  The **Environment variables** screen is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-settings-environment_variables.png["The Environment
variables screen", 1280, 620, role="frame"]

. In the **Create a new environment variable** area:

[loweralpha]
. In the **Name** field, enter: `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`.

. In the **Value** field, enter the access token that you created when
  you executed `danger init`.

. image:img/button-create.png["The Create button", 61, 30, role="right"]
  Click the **Create** button.
****
--

. Create a `buddybuild_postbuild.sh` script at the root of your
  repository with the following content:
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
chruby 2.3.1
bundle install
bundle exec danger --fail-on-errors=true
----

. Commit the `Dangerfile`.
+
[source,bash]
----
git add Dangerfile
git commit -m "Setup Danger with basic rules"
git push -u origin setup-danger
----

. Open your repository on GitHub and open a pull request with the
  `setup-danger` branch, using `[WIP]` in the pull request's title; this
  identifies the pull request as a _work in progress_. You should now
  see the result of Danger's processing as a comment to the pull
  request:
+
image:img/panel-danger-work_in_progress.png["Danger reporting a pull
request as a work in progress", 760, 184, role="frame"]

Now that Danger is configured, you can adjust the logic in the
`Dangerfile` to automate the CI steps that you require. See the
following examples for inspiration.

[[examples]]
== Examples


[[lint]]
=== Use Danger to ensure that coding style is respected

link:https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint[Swiftlint] is a tool that uses
link:https://clang.llvm.org/[Clang] and
link:https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/tools/SourceKit[SourceKit]
to parse your source files and check them against a set of rules that
you can fully customize.

This example demonstrates how to add Swiftlint to Danger:

. Edit your `Gemfile` so that it includes the following line:
+
[source,ruby]
----
gem 'danger-swiftlint', '~> 0.5.1'
----

. Run `bundle install` to install the new dependency.

. Edit your `Dangerfile` to include the following line:
+
[source,ruby]
----
swiftlint.lint_files
----

. Commit the configuration changes to your repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
git add Gemfile Dangerfile
git commit -m 'Add Swiftlint to Danger.'
----

Now, whenever you create a pull request, Danger checks all of the
modified and added files in the pull request, and lists all of the
Swiftlint violations in a comment:

image:img/panel-danger-swiftlint.png["Danger reporting coding style
violations from Swiftlint", 760, 363, role="frame"]


[[coverage]]
=== Use Danger to maintain code coverage level

link:https://github.com/nakiostudio/xcov[xcov] is a visualizer for Xcode
code coverage files.

This example demonstrates how to add xcov to Danger:

. Edit your `Gemfile` so that it includes the following line:
+
[source,ruby]
----
gem 'danger-xcov', '~> 0.3.3'
----

. Run `bundle install` to install the new dependency.

. Edit your `Dangerfile` to include the following lines:
+
[source,ruby]
----
xcov.report(
   scheme: ENV['BUDDYBUILD_SCHEME'],
   project: "#{ENV['BUDDYBUILD_WORKSPACE']}/Project.xcodeproj",
   minimum_coverage_percentage: 30,
   derived_data_path: ENV['BUDDYBUILD_TEST_DIR'],
)
----

. Commit the configuration changes to your repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
git add Gemfile Dangerfile
git commit -m 'Add xcov to Danger.'
----

Now, whenever you create a pull request, Danger checks the level of code
coverage in your projects and **fails the build** if the percentage
falls below the value for `minimum_coverage_percentage` (30% in this
case):

percentage from xcov", 760, 353, role="frame"]


[[relnotes]]
=== Add release notes using Danger

Your app's users are often interested in what's new or changed in each
release of your app. You can provide a list of the changes in the file
`buddybuild_release_notes.txt`. When this file exists at the root of
your repository, its content is displayed as the release notes to your
users.

Developers often forget to update release notes, and reviewers often
forget to the that the release notes have been updated. Danger can
perform the release note checks for you.

The following example checks to see if Swift code can been modified, and
if so, whether the `buddybuild_release_notes.txt` file has also been
modified. If not, a warning is displayed.

[source,ruby]
----
modified_code = git.modified_files.include? "2048/*.swift"
updated_release_notes = git.modified_files.include? \
    "buddybuild_release_notes.txt"

fail "You forgot to update the release_notes_file\
    ([docs](http://docs.buddybuild.com/docs/focus-message))"\
    if modified_code && !updated_release_notes
----

notes have not been updated", 760, 184, role="frame"]
