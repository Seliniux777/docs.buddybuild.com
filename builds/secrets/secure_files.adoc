= Secure files

Secure files allow you to specify API keys, access tokens, or other
secrets that your build requires, without having them checked into your
repository.

Secure files are made available during a build to any process that can
use them, including link:../custom_build_steps.adoc[custom build steps].


== Step 1: Upload a Secure File to buddybuild

Launch the buddybuild dashboard and select **App Settings**.

In the left navigation, select **Build settings**, then **Secure
files**.

1500, 800]

Select the file you would like to upload and select **Upload file**

1500, 729]

Your file is now ready to be consumed by your app.


== Step 2: Consume the secure file in your build

Your secure files are automatically consumed by tools that are expecting
them.


== 2a. Consume in your custom build scripts.

If you would like to access them in your
link:../custom_build_steps.adoc[custom build scripts], use
the bash variable expansion syntax.

[source,bash]
----
./Example.framework/run ${BUDDYBUILD_SECURE_FILES}/file.txt
----


== 2b. Consume in Android `build.gradle` file.

If you are building an **Android** app with **Gradle** (Android Studio),
you can also access them 2 ways inside your `build.gradle` file.

You can access them via `System.getenv()`, like this:

[source,json]
----
signing.keyId=1234567
signing.password=secret
signing.secretKeyRingFile= new File(System.getenv("BUDDYBUILD_SECURE_FILES") + "/secring.gpg")
----

That's it! For more details, refer to our link:../../sdk/api.adoc[SDK API
guide].
