= Secure files

Secure files allow you to specify API keys, access tokens, or other
secrets that your build requires, without having them checked into your
repository.

Secure files are made available during a build to any process that can
use them, including link:../custom_build_steps.adoc[custom build steps].


== Step 1: Upload a Secure File to buddybuild

Your file is now ready to be consumed by your app.


== Step 2: Consume the secure file in your build

Your secure files are automatically consumed by tools that are expecting
them.

If you would like to access them in your
link:../custom_build_steps.adoc[custom build scripts], use the bash
variable expansion syntax.
