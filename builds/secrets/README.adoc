  This section covers the three sets of variables that buddybuild let you define
  to securely propagate your credentials to your build and app.

= Build secrets

You might have API keys, access tokens, or other secrets that your app
needs to consume -- either at run time or during a build. However, you
might not want to check these secrets into your source code to make them
available to your app.

In order to securely propagate your credentials to your build and app,
buddybuild provides three sets of variables that you can define:

. link:environment_variables.adoc[Environment Variables] (made available
  to your build time scripts)

. link:device_variables.adoc[Device Variables] (available your iOS app
  at run time via the buddybuild SDK)

. link:secure_files.adoc[Secure Files] (files made available to your
  build time scripts)

[IMPORTANT]
===========
If your app involves cross-repository pull requests, which are pull
requests against a fork of your repository, buddybuild does
not expose any secure environment variables, device variables, or secure
files during cross-repository builds. By default, such secrets are only
available to pull requests coming from the same organization and
repository.

As such a restriction may impact your app's development workflow,
buddybuild's dashboard allows you to specify which forked repositories
to trust:

. Log in to the link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild
  dashboard].

. image:../../builds/img/button-app_settings.png["The App Settings
  button", 118, 64, role="right"]
  Click **App Settings** button in the top toolbar. The **Default build
  configuration** screen is displayed:
+
image:../img/screen-build_settings.png["The Default
build configuration screen", 1280, 1024, role="frame"]

. In the **Build pull requests** row, click the **Configure** link. The
**Configure cross-repository pull requests** dialog is displayed:
+
image:img/dialog-configure_cross_repo_pull_requests.png["The Configure
cross-repository pull requests dialog", 1280, 1024, role="frame"]

. Click the toggle beside **Build cross-repository pull requests** to
  enable building of cross-repository pull requests.

. Either click the toggle beside **Build all forked repositories** to
  enable building of all forked repositories, or click the toggle beside
  any specific forked repositories listed.
===========

[WARNING]
=========
Trusting a forked repository increases your security risk. When you
configure buddybuild to build pull requests, users with access to the
forked repository can create a pull request that adds/changes a
link:../custom_build_steps.adoc[custom build step] such that it can
capture secrets, source code, etc., and can potentially be used to gain
full access to your main repository.
