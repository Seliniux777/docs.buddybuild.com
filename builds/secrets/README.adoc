= Build secrets

You might have API keys, access tokens, or other secrets that your app
needs to consume -- either at run time or during a build. However, you
might not want to check these secrets into your source code to make them
available to your app.

In order to securely propagate your credentials to your build and app,
buddybuild provides three sets of variables that you can define:

. link:environment_variables.adoc[Environment Variables] (made available
  to your build time scripts)

. link:device_variables.adoc[Device Variables] (available your iOS app
  at run time via the buddybuild SDK)

. link:secure_files.adoc[Secure Files] (files made available to your
  build time scripts)
