titletext: How to create device variables to secure passwords and keys
description: >
  Define device variables, that can be accessed during the build or at
  run-time, to store keys, access tokens, or other secrets required by
  your mobile app.
---
= Device variables

Device variables allow you to specify API keys, access tokens, or other
secrets that your app needs to consume at run time, without having them
checked in to your repository.

Device variables are made available to your app during run time via the
link:../../sdk/README.adoc[buddybuild SDK].

[IMPORTANT]
===========
Device variables are currently only available for iOS apps.

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Create Device Variables in buddybuild

Launch the buddybuild dashboard and click on **App Settings**.

In the left navigation, select **Build settings**, then **Device
Variables**.

button", 1500, 800]

Enter a name, value and select **Create**.

Buddybuild securely embeds your variable into the app when it is built
next. Your variable is consumable via the buddybuild SDK.


== Step 2: Consuming the variable

To consume the variable in your build, substitute the name of your
device variable where applicable (see example below).

[source,swift]
----
let accessToken = BuddyBuildSDK.valueForDeviceKey("Facebook_Token")
----

[source,objectivec]
----
NSString* accessToken = [BuddyBuildSDK valueForDeviceKey:@"Facebook_Token"];
----

That's it! For more details, refer to our link:../../sdk/api.adoc[SDK API
guide].

If you want to consume your variables from within your build instead,
follow the link:environment_variables.adoc[Environment Variables] guide.
