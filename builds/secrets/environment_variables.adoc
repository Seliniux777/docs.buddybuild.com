  Use environment variables to expose custom settings, keys, or other

= Environment variables

Environment variables allow you to specify API keys, access tokens, or
other secrets that your build requires, without having them checked into
your repository.

Environment variables are made available during a build to any process
that can use them, including link:../custom_build_steps.adoc[custom
build steps].

You can create regular environment variables which are available to all
branches, or branch-specific environment variables which are only
available for a specific branch.

[[create]]
== Creating default environment variables

Start by clicking on **App Settings**.

image:../img/Builds---Settings.png["The buddybuild dashboard", 1500, 483]

In the left navigation, select **Build settings**, then the
**Environment** tab.

image:../img/Settings---Environment-variables---menu.png["The Default build
configuration screen, with the Environment tab selected", 1500, 459]

In the Environment variables row, click **Configure**.

image:../img/Settings---Environment-variables---configure.png["The Default
build configuration screen, clicking the Configure button for
Environment variables", 1500, 691]

Enter a name and value to create a default environment variable. Your
environment variable is now ready to be consumed by your app at build
time.

Variables screen", 1280, 620, role="frame"]


== Create environment variables for a specific branch

You can also create environment variables for a specific branch by
creating a **branch-specific override**.

Under Override build configuration, click **Add a branch** and select
the branch you would like to create an environment variable for.

image:../img/Settings---Variants---Branch-specific-1.png["The Override
build configuration area, with the branch selection dropdown open",
1500, 555]

Select **Environment variables** from the dropdown and click
**Configure**.

image:../img/Settings---Environment-variables---Branch---configure.png["The
Override build configuration area, clicking the Configure button for the
Environment variables option", 1500, 540]

Enter a name and value to create your branch-specific environment
variable.

Variables screen for a specific branch", 1280, 620, role="frame"]


== Consume the variable in your build

Your environment variables will be automatically consumed by tools that
are expecting them.

[NOTE]
======
- link:#step2a[2a. Consume in your custom build scripts].

- link:#step2b[2b. Consume in Android build.gradle file].
======

[[step2a]]
== 2a. Consume in your custom build scripts.

If you would like to access them in your
link:../custom_build_steps.adoc[custom build scripts], use
the bash variable expansion syntax.

[source,bash]
----
./Example.framework/run $Crashlytics_Token
----

[[step2b]]
== 2b. Consume in Android build.gradle file.

If you are building an **Android** app with **Gradle** (Android Studio),
you can also access them 2 ways inside your `build.gradle` file.

You can access them via `System.getenv()`, like this:

[source,json]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    jcenter()
    maven {
      credentials {
        username System.getenv("ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME")
        password System.getenv("ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD")
      }
      url System.getenv("ARTIFACTORY_URL")
    }
  }
  ...
}
----

We also put these variables inside `gradle.properties` file, so you can
access them directly like:

[source,json]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    jcenter()
    maven {
      credentials {
        username ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME
        password ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD
      }
      url ARTIFACTORY_URL
    }
  }
  ...
}
----

That's it! If you want to consume your variables from within your app,
follow the link:device_variables.adoc[Device Variables] guide.
