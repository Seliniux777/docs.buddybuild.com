= Builds FAQ

This section provides answers to frequently-asked build questions. See
the link:../troubleshooting/README.adoc[Troubleshooting] section for
solutions to a variety of build problems.

== How do I build a specific commit?

- Create a branch pointing to the specific commit. Then use the
  link:https://apidocs.buddybuild.com/builds/post-trigger.html[REST API]
  to trigger a build for that branch.

- Push a tag the includes the desired commit.

- Click the **Rebuild** button for a previous build of the commit.


== How do I delete the history of builds from an old branch?

It is not possible to do so. Buddybuild tracks the history of all
builds; this detail is often useful and helps buddybuild improve its
service.

You can make an old branch less visible:

- Create additional branches; new branches push old branches out of
  view.

- Delete the branch. The branch ... FIXME.
