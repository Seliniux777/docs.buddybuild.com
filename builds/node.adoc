= Node version

node.js, or just _Node_, is a popular javascript runtime that can be
used for application development or system tools. Node itself is
evolving rapidly, which means that new features are available regularly.
It also means that existing features might change or become deprecated.
Your use of Node may depend on specific versions in order to function
correctly. This section describes how to use a specific version of Node.
