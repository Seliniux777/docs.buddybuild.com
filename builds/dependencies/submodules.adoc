= Submodules

Git Submodules are a way to manage your App's dependencies. In order for
buddybuild to build your App, we need access to all your submodules in
your source tree. We'll automatically use the Git credentials associated
with your account.

If your repo contains a `.gitmodules` file, then buddybuild will clone
all of those submodules automatically. In other words, there's no need
to explicitly run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in a custom
post-clone script.

Any private submodules that require additional credentials that are not
in buddybuild will not be accessible during the cloud build. So ensure
that all your private submodules are accessible using your git user
identities known to buddybuild.
