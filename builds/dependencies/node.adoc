titletext: How to use specific Node.js versions, and private packages
description: >
  Your project may require a specific version of Node.js. Or, you may
  need to use private npm packages. This section shows you how to do
  both.

= Node.js

Node.js, or just _Node_, is a popular JavaScript runtime that can be
used for application development or system tools.

This section covers the following topics:

- <<node_version>>
- <<private_npm>>

[[node_version]]
== Specify the Node version

Node itself is evolving rapidly, which means that new features are
available regularly. It also means that existing features might change
or become deprecated. Your use of Node may depend on specific versions
in order to function correctly. See how to use a specific version of
Node in the following steps:

. Log in to the link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild
  dashboard].

.  image:../img/button-current_app.png["The Current App button", 123, 64,
role="right"]
  Choose the app that requires a specific Node version by moving your
  pointer over the **current app** button in the top toolbar. The
  **Apps** dropdown appears:
+
image:../img/dropdown-apps.png["The Apps dropdown", 362, 608]

. Select the app that needs a specific Node version by clicking it in
the dropdown. The **Builds** page for your app appears:
+

role="frame"]
+
image:../img/field-filter_apps.png["The App dropdown's filter field",
283, 32, role="right"]
If you have many apps, you can type the app's name (or portion thereof)
into the search field; only apps with matching names are displayed.
+

Or, you can click the sort order button to display a select menu of
sorting approaches. Click the select menu to display all of the
approaches:
+
--
- **Alphabetical (A-Z)** Select to show apps in normal, alphabetical
  order. This is the default.

- **Alphabetical (Z-A)** Select to show apps in reverse alphabetical
  order.

- **Created Date** Select to show the most recently added apps first.

. image:../img/button-app_settings.png["The App Settings button", 118, 64,
role="right"]
  Click the **App Settings** button in the top toolbar.
  The **App Settings** screen is displayed:
+

691, role="frame"]

. image:../img/tab-environment.png["The Environment tab", 137, 53,
role="right"]
  Click the **Environment** tab. The **Environment** settings are
  displayed:

. image:../img/dropdown-node_versions.png["The Node versions select menu",
331, 275, role="right"]
  Click the **Node version** select menu to display the available Node
  versions.

. Click the version of Node that you need for your build.

That's it! From now on, builds of your app use the selected Node
version.


[[private_npm]]
== Private npm packages

You can configure buddybuild to use private npm packages. This makes it
much easier to mix public packages with custom, private code you have
written. For more information on private packages, see
link:https://docs.npmjs.com/private-modules/intro[Working with private
modules].

Using private npm packages requires an account on
link:https://npmjs.com/[npmjs.com]. If you do not already have an
account, link:https://www.npmjs.com/signup[sign up for a free account].

Once you have an npmjs.com account, you can then acquire the
`access_token` which gives you access to all npm packages to which you
have at least `read` permissions. Then you can set a buddybuild
environment variable to make the access token available to your build.
Finally, you can create (or update) the `buddybuild_postclone.sh` script
to configure npm to use your access token and install your private
package dependencies.

Follow these steps:

. **Capture the npm access token**:

. From the command line, log in to npm:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm login
----
+
You are prompted for your npmjs.com username, password, and email
address.

. Copy the access token from `~/.npmrc`.
+
[source,bash]
----
cat ~/.npmrc
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=cb31c41d-3bq8-7285-fe20-361ea25e3c1e
----
+
The access token is the value after `_authToken=`, in this case:
`cb31c41d-3bq8-7285-fe20-361ea25e3c1e`.
--

. **Set a buddybuild environment variable**, to provide the npm access
  token to your build:

. Log in to the link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild
  dashboard].

. image:../img/button-app_settings.png["The App Settings button",
  118, 64, role="right"]
  Click **App Settings** button in the top toolbar. The **Default build
  configuration** screen is displayed:
+
image:../img/screen-build_settings.png["The Default build configuration
screen", 1280, 691, role="frame"]

. image:../img/tab-environment.png["The Environment tab", 137, 53,
  role="right"]
  Click the **Environment tab**. The **Environment** settings screen is
  displayed:
+
image:../img/screen-environment_settings.png["The Environment
settings", 1280, 619, role="frame"]

. image:../img/button-configure.png["The Configure button", 81, 30,
  role="right"]
  In the **Environment variables** row, click the **Configure** button.
  The **Environment variables** screen is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-environment_variables.png["The Environment variables
screen", 1280, 518, role="frame"]

. In the **Name** field, enter `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN`.

. In the **Value** field, enter the npm access token that you copied
  previously.

. image:img/button-create.png["The Create button", 61, 30, role="right"]
  Click the **Create** button.

. **Configure the build to use the environment variable**:
+

[loweralpha]
. Create (or update) the `buddybuild_postclone.sh` script in the root of
  your app's repository, so that it contains the following lines:
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

npm config set //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken $NPM_AUTH_TOKEN
npm install
----

. Commit the change to `buddybuild_postclone.sh`.
--

That's it! Your builds now have access to your npm access token, and
your app's npm dependencies are installed, including any private
packages where you have `read` permissions.
