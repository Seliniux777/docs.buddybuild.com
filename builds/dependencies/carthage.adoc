  Buddybuild supports using Carthage for managing dependencies.

= Carthage

link:https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage[Carthage] is a fantastic way
to manage dependencies.

In order to guarantee repeatability in builds -- we recommend you check
in both your `Cartfile` and `Cartfile.resolved` files into your source
control.

[IMPORTANT]
===========
When Carthage downloads dependencies, they appear in the `Carthage`
directory. If you commit this directory to your repository, **buddybuild
does not run the `carthage` command** because it assumes that you have
taken responsibility for managing the Carthage dependencies.
===========


== Carthage version

You can set the Carthage version that is used on every build in your App
Settings or in your branch settings.

== Running a custom Carthage command

If the predefined Carthage command doesn't work for you, buddybuild lets
you use your own. To achieve that, create a
`buddybuild_carthage_command.sh` file with your custom command at the
root of your project.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

carthage bootstrap --platform ios,tvOS --use-ssh --no-build
----

Buddybuild automatically runs this script instead of the regular
Carthage command if it's present in your repository.
