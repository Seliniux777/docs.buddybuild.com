= Device Variables

You might have API keys and other secrets that your app needs to consume
-- either at run time or during a build. However, you might not want to
check these secrets into your source code to make them available to your
app.

In order to securely propagate your credentials to your build and app,
buddybuild provides two sets of variables that you can define:

. link:environment_variables.adoc[Environment Variables] (made available
  to your build time scripts)

. Device Variables (available your App at run time via the buddybuild
  SDK)

. link:secure_files.adoc[Secure Files] (files made available to your
  build time scripts)

Let's get started with Device Variables!

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Create Device Variables in buddybuild

Launch the buddybuild dashboard and click on **App Settings**.

In the left navigation, select **Build settings**, then **Device
Variables**.

button", 1500, 800]

Enter a name, value and select **Create**.

Buddybuild securely embeds your variable into the app when it is built
next. Your variable is consumable via the buddybuild SDK.


== Step 2: Consuming the variable

To consume the variable in your build, substitute the name of your
device variable where applicable (see example below).

[source,swift]
----
let accessToken = BuddyBuildSDK.valueForDeviceKey("Facebook_Token")
----

[source,objectivec]
----
NSString* accessToken = [BuddyBuildSDK valueForDeviceKey:@"Facebook_Token"];
----

That's it! For more details, refer to our link:../sdk/api.adoc[SDK API
guide].

If you want to consume your variables from within your build instead,
follow the link:environment_variables.adoc[Environment Variables] guide.
