= Remote access

Remote access is a feature that allows you to access a build machine
while a build is under way. This can make diagnosing build failures much
easier than scanning through log files.

[NOTE]
======
Remote access is only available to buddybuild customers on a paid plan.
======

== Connect with remote access

After an initial build completes (successfully, or not), a **Rebuild
with SSH** button appears on the build details page:

image:img/screen-build_details-with_ssh.png["The build details screen
with the Rebuild with SSH button", 1280, 1024, role="frame"]

. image:img/button-rebuild_with_ssh.png["The Rebuild with SSH button",
200, 200, role="right"]
  Click the **Rebuild with SSH** button. A dialog appears:
+

dialog", 1280, 1024, role="frame"]

. image:img/button-FIXME.png["The Rebuild button", 200, 200, role="right"]
  Click the *Rebuild** button.
+
At this point, buddybuild attempts to acquire your public key from your
source code repository. If unsuccessful, you cannot use remote access.
+
If successful, the build begins. After the VM running your build starts
up, SSH access details appear:
+
image:img/screen-rebuild_with_ssh-details.png["The SSH access details
for this build", 1280, 1024, role="frame"]

. Use SSH to connect to the build VM.
+

SSH", 1280, 1024, role="frame"]

At this point, you can do whatever you need to diagnose your build.

[TIP]
=====
buddybuild does not store any changes you make while the build is
underway. Commit any required changes to your repository so that
subsequent builds can complete successfully.
=====

[IMPORTANT]
===========
You can use remote access until 20 minutes after the build completes
(successfully, or not). Once that period has elapsed, the VM is shut
down.
===========

== Screen sharing

Screen sharing is enabled during a remote access build. The second IP
address and port shown is for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections.

[CAUTION]
=========
Be aware that RDP connections to buddybuild VMs are **unencrypted**. If
you require an encrypted connection, use the X11 protocol forwarding
facility available via SSH.
=========

== Directory layout

When you connect to a build VM via remote access, the current directory
contains:
