= Remote access

Remote access is a feature that allows you to access a build machine, via
SSH or screen sharing, while a build is under way. This can make
diagnosing build failures much easier than scanning through log
files. Remote access can also reduce the time required to get
link:custom_build_steps.adoc[custom build steps] working.

[NOTE]
======
Remote access is only available to buddybuild customers on a Business
plan, or higher.
======

Buddybuild makes access easy: when you rebuild your app with remote
access enabled, buddybuild collects the public SSH keys stored in your
source code repository and configures them in the build machine. Once
the SSH configuration is complete, buddybuild provides the connection
details so that you can connect right away. Screen sharing access is
also provided, using the Virtual Network Computing protocol (VNC).

You can watch the build progress, tail logs, make adjustments to build
scripts, anything that would help future builds succeed more often. You
have up to 20 minutes after the build completes, successfully or
otherwise, before the VM running your build is retired and deleted.

We ask that you don't abuse this facility. Remote access is provided so
that you can improve your builds. Undesirable behavior via remote access
could result in termination of this feature.

[IMPORTANT]
===========
When you use remote access, make sure that you commit and push any
changes you want to keep; nothing is saved when the VM is deleted.
===========


== Connect via remote access

. Log in to the link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild
  dashboard].

. Click the build that you'd like to diagnose with remote access. The
  build details screen is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-build_details-with_ssh.png["The build details screen
with the Rebuild with Remote Access button", 1280, 559, role="frame"]
+
[IMPORTANT]
===========
If you do not see the **Rebuild with Remote Access** button, you should
contact sales@buddybuild.com to upgrade your plan.
===========

. image:img/button-rebuild_with_remote_access.png["The Rebuild with
Remote Access button", 188, 30, role="right"]
  Click the **Rebuild with Remote Access** button. Buddybuild begins
  retrieving your public keys:
+
image:img/screen-remote_access-retrieving_keys.png["The Retrieving your
keys dialog", 1280, 420, role="frame"]
+
What you see next depends on whether there are public keys available or
not:
+
--
[loweralpha]
. If there are no public keys available in connected source code
  repositories, the following dialog is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-remote_access-add_key_dialog.png["The Add a public key
for Remote Access dialog", 1280, 598, role="frame"]
+
image:img/button-add_key.png["The Add key button", 70, 30, role="right"]
Click the **Add key** button to use GitHub's interface to add a public
key.

. If there are one or more public keys available, the following dialog
  is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-remote_access-dialog.png["The Remote Access dialog",
1280, 616, role="frame"]
+
Click the **Manage keys** link to visit the source code provider's key
management interface.
--

. image:img/button-rebuild.png["The Rebuild button", 179, 34,
  role="right"]
  Once you click the **Rebuild** button, buddybuild starts the build. As
  soon as the build machine is up and running, buddybuild installs your
  public key(s) and displays the connection details. Both the SSH and
  screen sharing connection details are presented:
+
image:img/panel-remote_access-ios.png["A build's remote access
connection details", 870, 226, role="frame"]

. Use SSH to connect to the build VM.
+
--
[loweralpha]
. image:img/button-clipboard.png["The Clipboard button", 14, 15,
  role="right"]
  Click the clipboard icon beside the SSH command, to copy the command.

. Open a terminal and paste the command, then press **Return**.
--
+
image:img/screen-remote_access-terminal.png["A terminal connected via
SSH", 570, 438, role="frame"]

At this point, you can do whatever you need to diagnose your build. When
the 20 minutes after the build completes has expired, the remote access
connection details panel is replaced with:

image:img/panel-remote_access_no_longer_available.png["The remote access
is no longer available panel", 870, 100, role="frame"]

[IMPORTANT]
===========
When you use remote access, make sure that you commit and push any
changes you want to keep; nothing is saved when the VM is deleted.
===========


[[screenshare]]
== Screen sharing for builds

Screen sharing is enabled for builds when you rebuild with remote
access, and uses the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) protocol.

To use screen sharing:

. image:img/button-clipboard.png["The Clipboard button", 14, 15,
  role="right"]
  Click the clipboard icon beside the **URL** value, to copy the URL.

. In the MacOS Finder's **Go** menu, select **Connect to server...**.
  The **Connect to Server** dialog appears:
+
image:img/dialog-connect_to_server.png["The Connect to Server dialog",
487, 232, role="frame"]

. In the **Server Address** field, type `vnc://` and then paste the URL.
  The combined value should look something like:
  `vnc://access.buddybuild.com:13108`
+
[NOTE]
======
Do not save this connection as a favorite. The build VM is retired and
deleted 20 minutes after your build completes, and you won't be able to
access it again after that period.
======

. image:img/button-finder-connect.png["The Connect button", 83, 20,
  role="right"]
  Click the **Connect** button. A dialog appears asking for the name
  and password to connect to access.buddybuild.com:
+
image:img/dialog-finder-credentials.png["The Finder's credentials
dialog", 431, 231, role="frame"]

. In the **Name** field, type `customer` (or copy that value from the
  **Username** field in your browser).

. image:img/button-clipboard.png["The Clipboard button", 14, 15,
  role="right"]
  In your browser, click the clipboard icon beside the **Password**
  field.

. Paste the password into the **Password** field in the dialog.

. image:img/button-finder-connect.png["The Connect button", 83, 20,
  role="right"]
  Click the **Connect** button to start the connection. Another dialog
  appears asking how you would like to connect:
+
image:img/dialog-finder-share.png["The Finder's connection mode dialog",
431, 209, role="frame"]

. image:img/button-finder-connect.png["The Connect button", 83, 20,
  role="right"]
  Select **Share the display** and click **Connect**. The shared desktop
  of the build VM appears:
+
image:img/screen-screensharing.png["The shared screen of the build VM",
1024, 836, role="frame"]

You can now operate the build VM as you see fit.

[CAUTION]
=========
Be aware that VNC connections to buddybuild VMs are **not encrypted**.
If you require an encrypted connection, see <<encrypt_vnc>>.
=========


[[encrypt_vnc]]
== Encrypted VNC connection

The VNC protocol does not include connection encryption. However, you
can tunnel the VNC connection through the SSH connection.

To setup the SSH tunnel:

. image:img/button-clipboard.png["The Clipboard button", 14, 15,
  role="right"]
  Click the clipboard icon beside the SSH command, to copy the command.

. Open a terminal and paste the command. **DO NOT PRESS RETURN YET**.

. Add `-L 5900:localhost:5900` to the command. The full command should
look something like:
+
[source,text]
----
ssh buddybuild@access.buddybuild.com -p 12160 -L 15900:localhost:5900
----
+
This sets up a tunnel from port 15900 on `localhost` (your computer) to
port 5900 on the build VM, via the SSH connection. We're using 15900 in
this example instead of 5900, to avoid problems if you have screen
sharing enabled on your computer.

. Press **Return**. At this point, the SSH connection is established,
  including the tunnel for the VNC connection.

. Follow the steps in <<screenshare>>, but use the following value for
  the **Server Address** field instead:
+
[source,text]
----
vnc://localhost:15900
----


== Directory layout

When you connect to a build VM via remote access, the current directory
contains:

[source,text]
----
BBCheckCleanDummy.tmp
Desktop/
Documents/
Downloads/
Library/
Movies/
Music/
Pictures/
Public/
bin/
secure_files/
workspace@
----

- `secure_files` +
  Any link:secrets/secure_files.adoc[secure files] created in the
  buddybuild dashboard are copied to this folder at the start of every
  build.

- `workspace` +
  Your project's source code is copied to this folder (which is a
  symlink to `/tmp/sandbox/workspace`).
