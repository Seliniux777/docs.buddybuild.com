= Disable a Build

Buddybuild allows you to disable deployed builds. Disabling a build
prevents testers from installing that specific build and gives you a
quick way to prevent users from accessing a deployed build.

Disabled builds no longer receive Feedback and Crash Reports.

Here's how to disable a build:

. Select the build you wish to disable.

click on the **Re-enable this build** button.
