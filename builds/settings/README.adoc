  Default build settings apply to all new apps added to your
  organization, and can be applied selectively to existing apps.

= Build settings for all apps

Each of the available link:../README.adoc[build] settings are
app-specific. This section describes how you can specify build settings
that automatically apply to new apps, or that can be applied to any
applications that already exist within an organization.

[IMPORTANT]
Some build settings cannot be applied in bulk. If you do not find a
specific setting listed in the build settings for all apps, you need to
configure that setting for each individual app.

This page contains the following sub-sections:

- <<access>>
- <<apply>>
