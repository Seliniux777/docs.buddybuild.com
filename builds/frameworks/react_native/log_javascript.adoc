= Log React Native JavaScript using the buddybuild SDK (iOS)

The buddybuild SDK is a lightweight yet powerful
link:../../../quickstart/integrate_sdk.adoc[suite of tools] that
integrates seamlessly into your application. Among the many features
the SDK provides, you can use the buddybuild SDK to capture JavaScript
logs in the Crash and Feedback reports logs.

Here are the step-by-step instructions to configure your app to capture
JavaScript logs emitted by `console.log`, `console.error`, etc. using
the buddybuild SDK:


== Step 1: Install the buddybuild SDK

The SDK needs to be integrated into your main app prior to configuring
React Native JavaScript logging.

We highly recommend using the
link:{{readme.path}}/quickstart/integrate_sdk.adoc[**automatic**
buddybuild SDK integration] right from your dashboard. However, if you
wish to install the buddybuild SDK **manually**, follow
link:{{readme.path}}/sdk/integration.adoc[these steps].


== Step 2: Get the latest version

Follow link:../../../quickstart/integrate_sdk.adoc#update[these
instructions] to update the SDK on your local machine.


== Step 3: Make the following changes in your app delegate:

First, add the following imports.

[source,objectivec]
----
#import &lt;asl.h&gt;
#import "RCTLog.h"
----

Then, add the following lines in `application:
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`, right after `[BuddyBuildSDK setup];`.

[source,objectivec]
----
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  [BuddyBuildSDK setup];

  RCTSetLogThreshold(RCTLogLevelInfo);
  RCTSetLogFunction(BuddyBuildReactNativeLogFunction);

  // Your code here

  return YES;
}
----

And finally, implement `BuddyBuildReactNativeLogFunction`

Copy/paste the snippet below at the very bottom of your app delegate,
right before the `@end`.

[source,objectivec]
----
RCTLogFunction BuddyBuildReactNativeLogFunction = ^(RCTLogLevel level, __unused RCTLogSource source, NSString *fileName, NSNumber *lineNumber, NSString *message) {
  NSString *log = RCTFormatLog([NSDate date], level, fileName, lineNumber, message);
  NSString *theLog = [NSString stringWithFormat: @"[REACT NATIVE LOG] %s", log.UTF8String];
  [BuddyBuildSDK log:theLog];
  int aslLevel;
  switch(level) {
    case RCTLogLevelTrace:
      aslLevel = ASL_LEVEL_DEBUG;
      break;
    case RCTLogLevelInfo:
      aslLevel = ASL_LEVEL_NOTICE;
      break;
    case RCTLogLevelWarning:
      aslLevel = ASL_LEVEL_WARNING;
      break;
    case RCTLogLevelError:
      aslLevel = ASL_LEVEL_ERR;
      break;
    case RCTLogLevelFatal:
      aslLevel = ASL_LEVEL_CRIT;
      break;
  }
  asl_log(NULL, NULL, aslLevel, "%s", message.UTF8String);
};
----


== Step 4: Verify

Add a `console.log` line (similar to the example below) in your
JavaScript code base.

[source,javascript]
----
console.log("Testing React Native logging with the buddybuild SDK");
----

Then run your application in Xcode. In the Xcode output pane you should
see the following log line, which indicates that the buddybuild SDK will
now log JavaScript logs.

.Xcode logs
[source,text]

----

== Step 5: Commit and push

Commit and push the changes to your repo to add the buddybuild SDK.

[source,bash]
----
git commit -am 'The buddybuild SDK now captures JavaScript console.logs'
git push
----

Your code push will be picked up by buddybuild. All subsequent Feedback
and Crash Reports will capture JavaScript logs.
