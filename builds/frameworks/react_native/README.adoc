Buddybuild natively supports React Native apps - for both iOS and Android.

There are two steps to make sure that your React Native project is ready
to onboard onto buddybuild.

- Run **react-native run-android** or **react-native run-ios**

- Ensure that you can build and run the project in **Android Studio** or
  **Xcode**

After you've confirmed that both of those conditions have been meet,
you're ready to add them to buddybuild!

Instructions for how to add apps to buddybuild can be found here:
link:../../../quickstart/android/select_an_app.adoc[Sign up with
buddybuild]

[NOTE]
You'll need to add each platform as a separate app in buddybuild.
