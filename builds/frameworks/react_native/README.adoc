Buddybuild natively supports React Native apps for iOS.

There are two steps to make sure that your React Native project is ready
to onboard onto buddybuild.

- Run `react-native run-ios`

- Ensure that you can build and run the project in **Xcode**

After you've confirmed that both of those conditions have been meet,
you're ready to link:{{readme.path}}/quickstart/select.adoc[add them to
buddybuild!]

NOTE: You need to add each platform as a separate app in buddybuild.
