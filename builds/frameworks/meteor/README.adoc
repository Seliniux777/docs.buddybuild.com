= Meteor Setup

While buddybuild natively supports Cordova, additional steps are
required to integrate Meteor into your build.

To start with, ensure you have checked in the `.meteor` folder in your
project, excluding the `local` folder as buddybuild doesn't need it.
Without it, buddybuild won't be able to build your project.


== New Project

First, we need to tell buddybuild how to build your meteor project. We
can do this by having a `buddybuild_postclone.sh` file in the root of your
repository. You can find more information about our custom build steps
link:../../custom_build_steps.adoc[here].

.buddybuild_postclone.sh
[source,bash]
----
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
meteor add-platform $PLATFORM
meteor build $PLATFORM --server $SERVER
----

Once you have that file in your repository, follow the steps to
link:../../../quickstart/android/select_an_app.adoc[sign up with
buddybuild]. Your first build will fail, because buddybuild doesn't yet
know about the `$PLATFORM` and `$SERVER` environment variables we are
using in the `buddybuild_postclone.sh` script.

The `$PLATFORM` variable should be either **ios** or **android**,
depending on which platform you want to build this project for. The
`$SERVER` variable should represent your development server in the
format server:port. Once you've added those 2 variables, retry the
build.

Buddybuild detects many apps and frameworks within your project; make
sure to select the correct one.

For iOS projects, you should select the workspace project, the one not
within a `.meteor` folder. For Android, you can select the Android
project.
