= Downloading build artifacts

Buddybuild automatically manages your app bundles and dSYMs securely for
you. If you wish to deploy your app bundle to your testers and beta
users, use the **Deployments** tab.

[NOTE]
If you have not yet uploaded a
link:http://localhost/~ewan/docs2/deployments/ios/code_signing/index.html[code
signing certificate], buddybuild cannot properly sign your application.
This means that a successful build cannot be installed on a device, and
so buddybuild does not make the build artifact available for download.
Tests can be run successfully, as unsigned builds can be installed in a
simulator.

Buddybuild can automatically collect your crash reports and symbolicate
them with your App's dSYMs producing human-readable crash reports. To
enable this feature, link:../quickstart/ios/integrate_sdk.adoc[integrate
the buddybuild SDK].

You never have to manage your artifacts yourself. However, if you
require access to them, download them from the build details page of a
specific build:
