= Downloading build artifacts

Buddybuild automatically manages your app bundles and dSYMs securely for
you. If you wish to deploy your app bundle to your testers and beta
users, use the **Deployments** tab.

[NOTE]
Build artifacts are not retained, nor are they available for download,
unless you have
link:../deployments/ios/code_signing/certificate_management.adoc[uploaded
certificates and provisioning profiles].

Buddybuild can automatically collect your crash reports and symbolicate
them with your App's dSYMs producing human-readable crash reports. To
enable this feature, link:../quickstart/ios/integrate_sdk.adoc[integrate
the buddybuild SDK].

You never have to manage your artifacts yourself. However, if you
require access to them, download them from the build details page of a
specific build:
