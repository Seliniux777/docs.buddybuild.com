= Downloading build artifacts

Buddybuild automatically manages your app bundles and dSYMs securely for
you. If you wish to deploy your app bundle to your testers and beta
users, use the **Deployments** tab.

[NOTE]
If you have not yet uploaded a
link:../deployments/ios/code_signing/README.adoc[code signing
certificate], buddybuild cannot properly sign your application. This
means that a successful build cannot be installed on a device, and so
buddybuild does not make the build artifact available for download.
This situation does not prevent your tests from running.

Buddybuild can automatically collect your crash reports and symbolicate
them with your App's dSYMs producing human-readable crash reports. To
enable this feature, link:../quickstart/ios/integrate_sdk.adoc[integrate
the buddybuild SDK].

You never have to manage your artifacts yourself. However, if you
require access to them, download them from the build details page of a
specific build:
