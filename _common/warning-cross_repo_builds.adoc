[WARNING]
=========
Enabling cross-repository pull request builds means that you _trust_ the
forked repositories and their users. Trusting a forked repository
increases your security risk. When you configure buddybuild to build
pull requests, users with access to the forked repository can create a
pull request that adds/changes a
link:{{readme.path}}/../builds/custom_build_steps.adoc[custom build
step] such that it can capture secrets, source code, etc., and can
potentially be used to gain full access to your main repository.
