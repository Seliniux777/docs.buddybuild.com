[IMPORTANT]
===========
After an app has been built, it is not possible to alter, remove, or
replace the provisioning profile used during the build. Whenever
provisioning profile changes are required, your app needs to be rebuilt.

Xcode lets you create development provisioning profiles on your local
computer, for deploying apps to connected devices. However, you cannot
use a development provisioning profile to deploy your app to the App
Store or to other devices. To deploy to the App Store, or to testers,
you need to create a distribution provisioning profile in the Apple
Developer Portal, which requires an active Developer Program
subscription.
