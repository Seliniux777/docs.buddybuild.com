[IMPORTANT]
===========
After an app has been built, it is not possible to alter, remove, or
replace the provisioning profile used during the build. Whenever
provisioning profile changes are required, your app needs to be rebuilt.

If your app is built with a development provisioning profile, you
cannot deploy your app to the App Store without rebuilding your app with
a distribution provisioning profile.
