[IMPORTANT]
===========
For GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket repositories, it is better to use
buddybuild's integration with the repository API than it is to use SSH
access.

The buddybuild repository API integration provides immediate status
updates, support for pull request workflows, and automated access
management.

If you choose to use SSH to connect to your repo, buddybuild can only
access your repository's file content, and the features noted above do
not work.
