======
**SDK features for App Store and TestFlight Deployments**

App Store installs have all buddybuild SDK features **disabled** except
for crash reporting. The SDK determines whether an install is from the
App Store by checking the NSBundle's `appStoreReceiptURL`; only App
Store installed have the URL filled in.

TestFlight builds deployed with buddybuild have all of the buddybuild
SDK features that were enabled. If you don't want your TestFlight
deployments to have these features, you must turn them off in the
link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild dashboard] and submit
a new build to TestFlight.
