[NOTE]
======
**SDK features for iOS App Store and TestFlight Deployments**

iOS App Store installs have all buddybuild SDK features **disabled**
except for crash reporting. The SDK determines whether an install is
from the iOS App Store by checking the NSBundle's `appStoreReceiptURL`;
only iOS App Store-installed apps have the URL filled in.

TestFlight builds deployed by buddybuild have all of the buddybuild SDK
features that were enabled. If you don't want your TestFlight
deployments to have these features, you must turn them off in the
link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild dashboard] and submit
a new build to TestFlight.
