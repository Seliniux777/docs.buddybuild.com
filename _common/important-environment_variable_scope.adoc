[IMPORTANT]
===========
Any environment variables set by buddybuild are available to all phases
of a build.

However, environment variables set by scripts invoked by your build
tool, tests, or other build-related operations, are **only available
while those scripts are executing**.

For example, the environment variable `BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR` is only
available while Xcode is running, specifically when a Run Script is
executing.

If you need to persist environment variables across script executions,
you have a couple of options:

- specify the environment variables in the buddybuild dashboard --
  buddybuild takes care of making those environment variables available
  to your builds.

- write the definitions of the environment variables to a file,
  and read those definitions every time your scripts execute.
