[WARNING]
=========
**Can I turn off the SDK features for Android in production?**

The SDK features are turned off by default, you have control over which
feature to enable when deploying via email or directly to Google Play.

However, this is only true when you deploy from buddybuild. If you
download the `.apk` file and manually deploy it to Google Play, any
enabled SDK features remain active in that version.
