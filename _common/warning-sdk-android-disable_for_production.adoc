[WARNING]

**Can I turn off the SDK features for Android in production?**

By default, all SDK features are turned off when you deploy to Google
Play. You have control over which features to enable when deploying to
your testers via email.

However, this is only true when you deploy from buddybuild. If you
download the `.apk` file and manually deploy it to Google Play, any
enabled SDK features remain active in that version.
