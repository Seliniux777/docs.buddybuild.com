[NOTE]
======
When you upload your certificates to buddybuild, your app transitions
from using simulator builds to using device builds. Device builds
typically take longer than simulator builds, for several reasons:

- Code signing
- Provisioning profile management
- dSYM management
- Deployment (not possible for simulator builds)
- Archive builds (multiple architectures, bitcode, plus additional
  iTunes Connect requirements).

If you need faster builds while working on new features or bug fixes,
you can disable **Build for archive** in your app's build settings. You
need to re-enable this setting when you are preparing to deploy to
iTunes Connect.
