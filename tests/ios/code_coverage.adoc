= Code Coverage for iOS apps

Code coverage measures the degree to which your code is tested by a
particular test suite.

While your tests are executing, they exercise code paths of your app.
Code coverage gives you a record of all code branches passed over by
your tests and provides insight into exactly how much of your code base
is being exercised during testing.

Hereâ€™s how to enable Code Coverage for your iOS app:

- In Xcode, from the **Product** menu, choose **Scheme** and **Edit
  Scheme**

- Select the **Test** tab in the left column

- Toggle on the **Gather coverage data** checkbox

Now that Code Coverage is enabled in Xcode, the next step is to enable
Tests in buddybuild.

- First, navigate to your app in buddybuild.

- Next, simply click on **Settings** (the "Gear" icon in the header bar)
  and switch on **Tests**.

You'll now be presented with code coverage reports in the buddybuild
dashboard (the **Coverage** column):

You can also dig into the build details by selecting the **Code
Coverage** tab to see the breakdown:

== Want to exclude your CocoaPods dependencies from Code Coverage?

You can exclude your Pods from Code Coverage by adding the following
post install script in your **Podfile**.

.Podfile
[source,bash]

post_install do |installer|

# Disable code coverage for all Pods and Pods Project
installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
        config.build_settings['CLANG_ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE'] = 'NO'
    end
end
installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|
    config.build_settings['CLANG_ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE'] = 'NO'
end
end
