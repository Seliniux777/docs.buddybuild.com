= Configure your iOS UI tests for Video Replay

The buddybuild SDK is a lightweight yet powerful
link:../../quickstart/ios/integrate_sdk.adoc[suite of tools] that
integrates seamlessly into your application. Among the many features
the SDK provides, you can use the buddybuild SDK to record video of your
UI tests as they execute.

Here are the step-by-step instructions to configure the SDK in your UI
tests target:

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Install the buddybuild SDK

The SDK needs to be integrated into your main app prior to configuring
video recording for your UI tests target.

We highly recommend using the
link:../../quickstart/ios/integrate_sdk.adoc#step2[**automatic** buddybuild
SDK integration] right from your dashboard. However, if you wish to
install the buddybuild SDK **manually**, follow
link:../../sdk/integration.adoc[these steps].

[[step2]]
== Step 2: Get the latest version

Follow link:../../quickstart/ios/integrate_sdk.adoc#update[these
instructions] to update the SDK on your local machine.

[[step3]]
== Step 3: Add framework dependencies to your UI test target

* Open your project in Xcode.
* Highlight your project in the 'Project Navigator'.
* Select your target.
* Select the 'Build Phases' tab.
* Open 'Link Binaries With Libraries' expander.
* Repeat for each of the **AssetsLibrary**, **BuddyBuildSDK**,
  **CoreTelephony**, **CoreText**, **CoreMedia**, **AVFoundation**,
  **CoreVideo**, **QuartzCore** and **SystemConfiguration** frameworks:

** Click the + button.
** Select the required framework name
** Click 'Add'

[[step4]]
== Step 4: Initialize the buddybuild SDK

Add the `uiTestsDidReceiveRemoteNotification` call in your app
delegate's **didReceiveRemoteNotification** method.

[[code-samples]]
--
.Swift
[source,swift]
----
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any]) {
  BuddyBuildSDK.uiTestsDidReceiveRemoteNotification(userInfo)
  // Initial implementation below
}
----
--

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,objectivec]
----
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo {
    [BuddyBuildSDK uiTestsDidReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo];
    // Initial implementation below
}
----
--

If you haven't already implemented **didReceiveRemoteNotification** in
your app delegate, you'll need to create it.

[NOTE]
======
**Important**

**uiTestsDidReceiveRemoteNotification** will only run in buddybuild
while your UI tests run. It will not run when you build from Xcode on
your local machine, on real iOS devices, on TestFlight or on App Store
installs.
======

[[step5]]
== Step 5: Configure your UI test cases.

=== Start video recording for your UI test cases

Add the following line **after** each **XCUIApplication().launch()**
(generally called in the `setUp` function), call in your UI tests
code base. This will start recording the video right after your app is
launched by the UI test case.

[[code-samples]]
--
.Swift
[source,swift]
----
...
XCUIApplication().launch()
BuddyBuildSDK.startUITests()
...
----
--

[[code-samples]]
--
.Objective-C
[source,objectivec]
----
...
[[[XCUIApplication alloc] init] launch];
[BuddyBuildSDK startUITests];
...
----
--

=== Stop video recording for your UI test cases

Add the following line **before** each **super.tearDown** call in your
UI tests code base. This will stop the video recording and save the file
at the end of each UI test case.

[[code-samples]]
--
.Swift
[source,swift]
----
override func tearDown() {
  BuddyBuildSDK.stopUITests()
  super.tearDown()
}
----
--

[[code-samples]]
--
.Objective-C
[source,objectivec]
----
- (void)tearDown {
  [BuddyBuildSDK stopUITests];
  [super tearDown];
}
----
--

[[step6]]
== Step 6: Verify - Run your UI tests locally in Xcode

Run your UI tests locally (âŒ˜+U) in Xcode. In the output pane you should
see the following log line, which indicates that the buddybuild SDK has
been successfully integrated.

----

[[step7]]
== Step 7: Make sure Tests are enabled in buddybuild

Go to the buddybuild dashboard and make sure that Tests are enabled in
buddybuild. This setting can be found in the **'App Settings'** of your
app.

[[step8]]
== Step 8: Commit and push

Commit the change and push the changes to your repo to add the
buddybuild SDK.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,bash]
----
git add - -all
git commit -m 'Adding buddybuild SDK for UI tests video recording'
git push
----
--

That's it! Your code push will be picked up by buddybuild. All
subsequent builds of your App will now record a video for each of your
UI tests!
