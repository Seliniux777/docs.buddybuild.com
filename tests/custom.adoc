= Custom test reporting

Buddybuild automatically runs, parses, and displays test results from
XCTest and XCUITest. If you're using a third-party or homegrown test
framework (one that is not listed in buddybuild's
link:frameworks.adoc[supported test frameworks]), you can continue using
your test framework and have the results appear directly in the
buddybuild dashboard; it's easy!

. **Install the test framework and its dependencies**

You have several options, depending on the nature of your test
framework:

. Some test frameworks can be installed simply by declaring them as
  dependencies of your project.

. If your test framework is homegrown, commit it within your project or
  use a git submodule.

. For any other framework, include commands in the
  link:../builds/custom_build_steps.adoc#postbuild[`buddybuild_postbuild.sh`]
  script that fetch and install your test framework.

. **Configure and execute your tests via the
  link:../builds/custom_build_steps.adoc#postbuild[`buddybuild_postbuild.sh`]
  script**

. **Store the test results in JUnit format in a user-defined folder
  within the `buddybuild_artifacts` folder**
+
Test results can be in XML or JSON format. The folder name that you
choose informs the name of the that appears on the **Build Details**
screen. For example, if the test results are stored in
`buddybuild_artifacts/Jest`, the test results appear in a tab named
`Jest`:

some of the most common third-party test frameworks into buddybuild.
