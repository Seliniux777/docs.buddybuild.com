= Supported frameworks

There are many, many testing frameworks available, from popular
cross-platform frameworks, to custom testing infrastructure that could
be unique to your application.

Generally speaking, most 3rd-party test frameworks can be used with
buddybuild provided these conditions are met:

- The framework is available for installation whenever your app is
  built, or you have included it within your project's source code.

- The framework runs on a Unix-like operating system.
