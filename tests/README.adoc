= Tests

This section covers buddybuild's test infrastructure.

For each test run defined in your projects, buddybuild provides:

[pad]
- **Code snippets for failed tests** +
  If your test failed due to an assertion, the test details page shows a
  code snippet of the failing tests with the failed assertion
  highlighted.

[pad]
- **Screenshots for all UI tests** +
  Xcode takes screenshots of your app whenever it runs your UI tests.
  During a test run activity such as a swipe or tap causes a new
  screenshot to be recorded.
+
If your test is a UI test, the test details page contains the
screenshots capture by Xcode. Each screenshot appears with a description
of the corresponding activity.

[pad]
- **A detailed call stack for app crashes during test runs** +
  If you app crashes during a test, the test details page contains a
  call stack of the crash and a code snippet for each method call from
  your app.

[pad]
- **Support for `FBSnapshotTestCase`** +
  `FBSnapshotTestCase` is a testing framework that lets you easily test
  your app's views. It generates a snapshot of your view during a test
  and compares it to a reference image that your include with your
  source code.
+
If your project has a `FBSnapshotTestCase` test that fails, the test
details page displays the reference image, the generated image, and a
_snapshot diff_; an image highlighting where changes have occurred.

[pad]
- **All of the logs generated by the `xcodebuild` command** +
  Raw logs generated by `xcodebuild` are available in the test details
  page. System logs generated by your app are also included there.


== Test Frameworks

Buddybuild supports a variety of test frameworks, with automatic
detection and execution of **XCTest**, **XCUITest**, and **JUnit**
tests. link:frameworks.adoc[Supported frameworks] can be invoked using
link:../builds/custom_build_steps.adoc[custom build steps].
