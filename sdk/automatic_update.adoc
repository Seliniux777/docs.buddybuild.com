= Automatic Update

Receiving feedback on old builds is pointless -- you've probably already
fixed the issue you've received feedback on! It is crucial to keep your
testers and beta users updated on the very latest builds.

Using the buddybuild SDK, testers will receive an in-app prompt to
install a new build once itâ€™s been deployed.

[NOTE]
======
**There are three ways to set up deployments within buddybuild:**

- link:../deployments/manual.adoc[Deploy Manually]
- link:../deployments/automatic.adoc[Deploy Automatically]
- link:../deployments/scheduled.adoc[Scheduled Deployments]
======

Once deployments have been set up, simply

SDK] into your app to enable the **Automatic Update** feature.

The SDK also offers several other features in addition to Automatic
Updates. Follow the links below to learn more about you can supercharge
