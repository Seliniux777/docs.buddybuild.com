= SDK Manual Installation (iOS)

We highly recommend using the **automatic** buddybuild SDK integration
right from the buddybuild dashboard.

However, if you wish to install the buddybuild SDK **manually**, follow
the steps on this page.

[NOTE]
======
**Use CocoaPods?**

Include the link:http://cocoapods.org/pods/BuddyBuildSDK[BuddyBuildSDK]
pod in your Podfile and move on to link:#step4[Step 4]
======

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Getting Started

Navigate to your repository root directory.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,bash]
----
cd myAwesomeApp
----
--

[[step2]]
== Step 2: Download the buddybuild SDK

Ensure that you remove previous versions of the buddybuild SDK before
you start.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,bash]
----
rm -rf BuddyBuildSDK.framework*
----
--

Download and unzip the `BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip` file into your
project root directory.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,bash]
----
wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/buddybuild-sdk-builds/master/BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip
unzip BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip
rm -f BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip
----
--

[[step3]]
== Step 3: Add iOS frameworks

* Open your project in Xcode.
* Highlight your project in the 'Project Navigator'.
* Select your target.
* Select the 'Build Phases' tab.
* Open 'Link Binaries With Libraries' expander.
* Repeat for each of the **AssetsLibrary**, **BuddyBuildSDK**,
  **CoreTelephony**, **CoreText**, **CoreMedia**, **AVFoundation**,
  **CoreVideo**, **QuartzCore** and **SystemConfiguration** frameworks:
** Click the + button.
** Select the required framework name
** Click 'Add'

== Step 4 (Swift only): Include the SDK in your Bridging Header

Make sure you have a bridging header in your **Build Settings** in
Xcode.

If you don't have a bridging header, the fastest way to create one is to
temporarily add a new `.m` file to your project. Xcode will then prompt
you to create a bridging header. After it's created you can delete that
`.m` file.

**Include the SDK by adding the line below to your bridging header**

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,objectivec]
----
#import &lt;BuddyBuildSDK/BuddyBuildSDK.h&gt;
----
--


== Step 5 (Swift only): Initialize the buddybuild SDK

Find the class that implements the UIApplicationDelegate. The class
implementation should look something like this.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,swift]
----
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
----
--

Initialize the **BuddyBuildSDK** in the class, by adding the following
line to the **didFinishLaunchingWithOptions** method.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,swift]
----
BuddyBuildSDK.setup()
----
--

== Step 6 (Objective-C only): Initialize the buddybuild SDK

Find the class that implements the **UIApplicationDelegate**. The class
header file should look something like this.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,objectivec]
----
@interface AppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate>
----
--

We're interested in associated the class implementation file. Add this
import to the class implementation file.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,objectivec]
----
#import &lt;BuddyBuildSDK/BuddyBuildSDK.h&gt;
----
--

Initialize the **BuddyBuildSDK** in the class, by adding the following
line to the **didFinishLaunchingWithOptions** method.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,objectivec]
----
[BuddyBuildSDK setup];
----
--

== Step 7: Build

Run your application in Xcode.

== Step 8: Verify

In the Xcode output pane you should see the following log line, which
indicates that the buddybuild SDK has been successfully integrated.

2015-10-05 15:34:48.693 myAwesomeApp[25126:526527] BuddybuildSDK : Successfully integrated. Feedback tool, crash reporting and other features are disabled for local builds. Please build with https://dashboard.buddybuild.com to enable.

----
2015-10-05 15:33:24.562 myAwesomeApp[25126:526527] BuddybuildSDK : Disabled in the simulator
----
--

== Step 9: Push

Commit the change and push to your repo.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,bash]
----
git add --all
git commit -m 'Adding buddybuild SDK'
git push
----
--

That's it! Your code push will be picked up by buddybuild. Subsequent
builds of your App will now have the SDK integrated!
