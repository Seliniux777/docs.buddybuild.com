= Manual integration of the buddybuild SDK

We highly recommend using the **automatic** buddybuild SDK integration
right from the buddybuild dashboard. See the instructions
link:../quickstart/ios/integrate_sdk.adoc[for iOS] or
link:../quickstart/android/integrate_sdk.adoc[for Android].

However, if you wish to integrate the buddybuild SDK **manually**,
follow the platform-specific steps on this page:

- <<ios>>
- <<android>>


[[ios]]
== iOS integration steps pass:[<i class="fa fa-apple"></i>]

[NOTE]
======
**Use CocoaPods?**

Include the link:http://cocoapods.org/pods/BuddyBuildSDK[BuddyBuildSDK]
pod in your Podfile and move on to <<add-frameworks,Step 4>>.
======

. **Navigate to your repository root directory**.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd myAwesomeApp
----

. **Remove any previous version of the buddybuild SDK**.
+
[source,bash]
----
rm -rf BuddyBuildSDK.framework*
----

. **Download and unpack the buddybuild SDK**.
+
Download and unpack the
link:https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/buddybuild-sdk-builds/master/BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip[`BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip`]
file into your project's root directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/buddybuild-sdk-builds/master/BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip
unzip BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip
rm -f BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip
----

. [[add-frameworks]] **Add iOS frameworks**
+
****
[loweralpha]
. Open your project in Xcode.
. Highlight your project in the **Project Navigator**.
. Select your target.
. Select the **Build Phases** tab.
. Open **Link Binaries With Libraries** expander.
. Repeat for each of the **AssetsLibrary**, **BuddyBuildSDK**,
  **CoreTelephony**, **CoreText**, **CoreMedia**, **AVFoundation**,
  **CoreVideo**, **QuartzCore** and **SystemConfiguration** frameworks:
+
--
. Click the **`+`** button.
. Select the required framework name.
. Click **Add**.

****

. **Initialize the buddybuild SDK**.
+
****
[loweralpha]
. Find the class that implements the **UIApplicationDelegate**. The
  class implementation should look something like this:
+
[[code-samples]]
--
[source,swift]
.Swift
----
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
----

[source,objectivec]
.Objective-C
----
@interface AppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate>
----
--

. Add this import to the top of the class implementation's `.m` file:
+
[[code-samples]]
--
[source,swift]
.Swift
----
import BuddyBuildSDK
----

[source,objectivec]
.Objective-C
----
#import &lt;BuddyBuildSDK/BuddyBuildSDK.h&gt;
----
--

. Initialize the **BuddyBuildSDK** in the class, by adding the following
  line to the **didFinishLaunchingWithOptions** method:
+
[[code-samples]]
--
[source,swift]
.Swift
----
BuddyBuildSDK.setup()
----

[source,objectivec]
.Objective-C
----
[BuddyBuildSDK setup];
----
--
****

. **Run your application in Xcode**.

. **Verify that the SDK is integrated and working**.
+
In the Xcode output pane you should see the following log line, which
indicates that the buddybuild SDK has been successfully integrated.
+
.When running on a physical device

2015-10-05 15:34:48.693 myAwesomeApp[25126:526527] BuddybuildSDK : Successfully integrated. Feedback tool, crash reporting and other features are disabled for local builds. Please build with https://dashboard.buddybuild.com to enable.

.When running in a simulator
[source,text]
----
2015-10-05 15:33:24.562 myAwesomeApp[25126:526527] BuddybuildSDK : Disabled in the simulator
----

. **Commit the changes and push to your repository**.
+
[source,bash]
----
git add --all
git commit -m 'Adding buddybuild SDK'
git push
----

That's it! The SDK is now integrated into your iOS app, and becomes
active in subsequent builds, including the build started by your code
push.


[[android]]
== Android integration steps pass:[<i class="fa fa-android"></i>]

[TIP]
=====
As of November 2017, the buddybuild SDK for Android contains 279
methods.
=====

. **Add plugins to `build.gradle`**
+
In order to pull in the plugins needed to build the app with the SDK,
add the following line to your `build.gradle` file:
+
[source,json]
----
repositories {
    jcenter()

    maven {
      url 'https://dl.bintray.com/buddybuild/maven'
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.buddybuild:sdk:0.1.9@aar'
    compile 'com.squareup:seismic:1.0.2'
}
----
+
[TIP]
=====
Two things to note here:

. You can put the `repositories` section in the base `build.gradle` file,
  but you need to put it under the `allprojects` section.

. Note the `@aar` at the end of `com.buddybuild:sdk:0.1.9@aar`
=====

. **Add Permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml`**
+
The following permissions allow the SDK to send feedback, as well as to
collect adb logs in case of app crash:
+
[source,xml]
----
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_LOGS"/>
----

. **Setup the SDK in `Application.onCreate()`**
+
One last thing to do is to start up the SDK upon app start. All you need
to do is to add **BuddyBuild.setup(this)** to your **Application**
class.
+
[WARNING]
=========
This does **not** work properly when added to the **main activity**
class.
=========
+
[source,java]
----
package buddybuild.com.helloworldandroid;

import android.app.Application;
import com.buddybuild.sdk.BuddyBuild;

public class MainApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        BuddyBuild.setup(this);
    }
}
----

. **Commit the changes and push to your repository**.
+
[source,bash]
----
git add --all
git commit -m 'Adding buddybuild SDK'
git push
----

That's it! The SDK is now integrated into your Android app, and becomes
active in subsequent builds, including the build started by your code
push.
