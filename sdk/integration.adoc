= Manual integration of the buddybuild SDK

We highly recommend using the
link:../quickstart/integrate_sdk.adoc[**automatic** buddybuild SDK
integration] right from the buddybuild dashboard. However, if you wish
to integrate the buddybuild SDK **manually**, follow the steps on this
page:


== Manual integration steps

[NOTE]
======
**Use CocoaPods?**

Include the link:http://cocoapods.org/pods/BuddyBuildSDK[BuddyBuildSDK]
pod in your Podfile and move on to <<add-frameworks,Step 4>>.
======

. **Navigate to your repository root directory**.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd myAwesomeApp
----

. **Remove any previous version of the buddybuild SDK**.
+
[source,bash]
----
rm -rf BuddyBuildSDK.framework*
----

. **Download and unpack the buddybuild SDK**.
+
Download and unpack the
link:https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/buddybuild-sdk-builds/master/BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip[`BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip`]
file into your project's root directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/buddybuild-sdk-builds/master/BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip
unzip BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip
rm -f BuddyBuildSDK.framework.zip

. Open your project in Xcode.
. Highlight your project in the **Project Navigator**.
. Select your target.
. Select the **Build Phases** tab.
. Open **Link Binaries With Libraries** expander.
. Repeat for each of the **AssetsLibrary**, **BuddyBuildSDK**,
  **CoreTelephony**, **CoreText**, **CoreMedia**, **AVFoundation**,

. **Initialize the buddybuild SDK**.
+
****
[loweralpha]
. Find the class that implements the **UIApplicationDelegate**. The
  class implementation should look something like this:
+
[[code-samples]]
--
[source,swift]
.Swift
----
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
----

[source,objectivec]
.Objective-C
----
@interface AppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate>
----
--

. Add this import to the top of the class implementation's `.m` file:
+
[[code-samples]]
--
[source,swift]
.Swift
----
import BuddyBuildSDK
----

[source,objectivec]
.Objective-C
----
#import &lt;BuddyBuildSDK/BuddyBuildSDK.h&gt;
----
--

. Initialize the **BuddyBuildSDK** in the class, by adding the following
  line to the **didFinishLaunchingWithOptions** method:
+
[[code-samples]]
--
[source,swift]
.Swift
----
BuddyBuildSDK.setup()
----

[source,objectivec]
.Objective-C
----
[BuddyBuildSDK setup];
----
--
****

. **Run your application in Xcode**.

. **Verify that the SDK is integrated and working**.
+
In the Xcode output pane you should see the following log line, which
indicates that the buddybuild SDK has been successfully integrated.
+

----

. **Commit the changes and push to your repository**.
+
[source,bash]
----
git add --all
git commit -m 'Adding buddybuild SDK'
git push
----

That's it! The SDK is now integrated into your app, and becomes active
in subsequent builds, including the build started by your code push.
