= Feedback Reporter

Gathering feedback from your beta users can often be a clumsy process.
Feedback from your beta users often takes a variety of forms -- emails,
slack messages or verbal comments.

Most of the time, the context of the feedback is not entirely clear
without an accompanying screenshot. Taking screenshots, attaching them
to emails or uploading them to slack is an awkward and time-consuming
process -- which disincentivizes testers from leaving feedback.

The buddybuild SDK feedback reporter offers a way of submitting feedback
painlessly right from within your app, as soon as an issue is noticed by
your beta user. From anywhere within your app, taking a screenshot
brings up the **Feedback Reporter**. Beta users can annotate the
screenshot and add a comment -- providing you the exact context you need
to iterate on your app.

Buddybuild marshals the feedback into whatever form works best for you
-- Email, Slack, Jira, or even GitHub issues right in your project's
repo!
