= Add a GitHub webhook

A webhook notifies buddybuild of code changes that you make to your
repo. Whenever a new change is pushed, buddybuild automatically kicks
off a new build -- ensuring that you have up-to-date build status and
your testers have the very latest builds.

Let's get started!

. On the Builds page, in the red banner at the top of the page, click on
  **Resolve this issue.**

. In the dialog box that appears, **select and copy the webhook URL.**

. Navigate to your GitHub repository. In the right panel, select
  **Settings**.
