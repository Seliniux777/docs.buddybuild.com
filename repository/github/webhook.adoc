= Adding a GitHub Webhook

A webhook notifies buddybuild of code changes that you make to your
repo.  Whenever a new change is pushed, buddybuild automatically kicks
off a new build -- ensuring that you have up-to-date build status and
your testers have the very latest builds.

Let's get started!

On the Builds page, in the red banner at the top of the page, click on
**Resolve this issue.**

In the dialog box that appears, **select and copy the webhook URL.**
This URL is specific to your app and will be used to identify your app
when sending webhooks from GitHub.

Navigate to your GitHub repository. In the right panel, select
**Settings**.

Paste the URL you first copied into the **Payload URL** field.

Under **Content type,** select **application/x-www-form-urlencoded.**
You can leave the **Secret** field blank.

Once that expands, select **Pull Request** and **Push.** Ensure that
**Active** is selected, and click **Add webhook**. You're now done!
