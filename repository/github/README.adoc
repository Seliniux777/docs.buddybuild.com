= Adding a GitHub Repository

If your repository lives in GitHub, you can
link:../../quickstart/github.adoc[connect your repository
automatically], or connect via SSH if you prefer.

If you prefer SSH, buddybuild will automatically generate a secure SSH
key for you to install into your source control system. Buddybuild will
use this key to clone your repository.

Let's get started!

**Private git submodules and private cocoapods**

If your project depends on any code in other private git repos, the ssh
key will need to be added to those repos as well.

Buddybuild will checkout your project code and kick off a simulator
build. The build should finish within a few seconds.

That's it. You're now connected to buddybuild. The next step is to

your App.
