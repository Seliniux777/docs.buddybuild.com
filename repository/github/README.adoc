= Add a GitHub Repository

If your repository lives in GitHub, you can
link:{{readme.path}}/quickstart/connect/github.adoc[connect your
repository automatically], or connect via SSH if you prefer.

If you prefer SSH, buddybuild will automatically generate a secure SSH
key for you to install into your source control system. Buddybuild will
use this key to clone your repository.

Let's get started!

[WARNING]
=========
**Private git submodules and private cocoapods**

If your project depends on any code in other private git repos, the SSH
key needs to be added to those repos as well.

Navigate back to buddybuild and click on the **Build** button.

Buddybuild clones your project code and starts a simulator build. The
build should finish within a few minutes.

That's it! Your GitHub repository is now connected to buddybuild, and
your first build is under way. The next steps are:

- link:webhook.adoc[Add a GitHub webhook] to automatically notify
  buddybuild of repository changes.

- link:{{readme.path}}/quickstart/invite_testers.adoc[invite
  testers] to try out your app.
