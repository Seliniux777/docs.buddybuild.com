titletext: Using Webhooks for repo code change notifications
description: >
  Buddybuild uses Webhooks to start new builds, update build statuses,
  and notify testers of new builds, whenever changes are committed to
  your repository.

= Setting Up a Webhook

A webhook notifies buddybuild of code changes you make to your repo.
Whenever a new change is pushed, buddybuild will automatically kick off
a new build -- ensuring you have up-to-date build status and your testers
have the very latest builds.
