= Adding a Beanstalk Webhook

A webhook notifies buddybuild of code changes that you make to your
repository. Whenever a new change is pushed, buddybuild automatically
kicks off a new build -- ensuring that you have up-to-date build status
and your testers have the very latest builds.

Let's get started!

On the **Builds** page, in the red banner at the top of the page, click
on **Resolve this issue**.

In the dialog box that appears, **select and copy the webhook URL**.
This URL is specific to your app and is used to identify your app when
sending webhooks from Beanstalk.

Navigate to your Beanstalk repository. In the top navigation, select
**Settings**. Then select **Integration**.

is labeled **Modular Webhooks**.

- Name the webhook *buddybuild*.

- Paste the buddybuild webhook URL you first copied into the **URL** field.

- Select the *push*, *create_branch*, *delete_branch*, *create_tag* and
  *delete_tag* webhook triggers.

- Then click **Activate**
