= Add a GitLab Repository

If your repository lives in GitLab, you can
link:{{readme.path}}/quickstart/connect/gitlab_private.adoc[connect your
repository automatically], or connect via SSH if you prefer.

If you prefer SSH, buddybuild automatically generates a secure SSH key
for you to install into your source control system. Buddybuild uses this
key to clone your repository.

Let's get started!

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Enter the SSH Git Clone URL

Within the main page of your repository, look to the middle of the page
for the **HTTPS/SSH dropdown**. Click it and select **SSH** (if it is
not already selected).

[[step2]]
== Step 2: Add the SSH Key to Your GitLab Account

Highlight and copy the generated SSH key.

Add a new SSH Key by pasting the copied SSH key into the **Key** field,
and entering **Buddybuild** as the title.

[WARNING]
=========
**Private git submodules and private cocoapods**

If your project depends on any code in other private git repos, the SSH
key needs to be added to those repos as well.
=========

Navigate back to buddybuild and click on the **Build** button.

Buddybuild clones your project code and starts a simulator build. The
build should finish within a few minutes.

That's it! Your GitLab repository is now connected to buddybuild, and your
first build is under way. The next steps are:

- link:webhook.adoc[Add a GitLab webhook] to automatically notify
  buddybuild of repository changes.

- link:{{readme.path}}/quickstart/ios/invite_testers.adoc[invite
  testers] to try out your app.
