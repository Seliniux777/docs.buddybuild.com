= Adding a GitLab Webhook

A webhook notifies buddybuild of code changes that you make to your repo.
Whenever a new change is pushed, buddybuild automatically kicks off
a new build -- ensuring that you have up-to-date build status and your
testers have the very latest builds.

Let's get started!

On the Builds page, in the red banner at the top of the page, click on
**Resolve this issue**.

In the dialog box that appears, **select and copy the webhook URL**.
This URL is specific to your app and is used to identify your app when
sending webhooks from GitLab.

Navigate to your GitLab repository. In the top right corner, select the
**Settings dropdown**.

You're now done!
