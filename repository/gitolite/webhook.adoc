titletext: Add a Gitolite webhook to your mobile app's CI process
description: >
  Use Gitolite Webhooks to notify buddybuild of repo code changes so we
  can kick off new builds, update build statuses and notify testers of
  latest builds.

= Add a Gitolite webhook

A webhook notifies buddybuild of code changes you make to your repo.
Whenever a new change is pushed to Gitolite, buddybuild will
automatically kick off a new build -- ensuring you have up-to-date build
status and your testers have the very latest builds.

Since Gitolite core does not have webhook functionality by default, we
describe how to extend Gitolite to provide this functionality using the
git post-receive script called
link:https://github.com/metajack/notify-webhook[notify-webhook].

[NOTE]
======
**Only a Gitolite admin user can add a Gitolite webhook**
======

== Step 1: Copy the webhook URL from buddybuild

On the Builds page, in the red banner at the top of the page, click on
**Resolve this issue.**

buddybuild dashboard", 1500, 298]

In the dialog box that appears, **select and copy the webhook URL**.

[NOTE]
======
**notify-webhook requires python3 and simplejson**

For more information see https://github.com/metajack/notify-webhook
======

== Step 2: Enable repo-specific-hooks, site-local gitolite code and whitelist notify-webhook keys

In this section we will be following the
link:http://gitolite.com/gitolite/cookbook.html#v3.6-variation-repo-specific-hooks[Gitolite
documentation] to enable repository-specific webhooks, if not already
enabled.

On the Gitolite server modify the`.gitolite.rc` file as follows:

- To enable `repo-specific-hooks` uncomment the `repo-specific-hooks`
  line in the `gitolite.rc` file or add it to the `ENABLE` list if it
  doesn't exist.

- To enable site-local gitolite code add this line in the `gitolite.rc`
  file, within the `%RC` block, if it's not already present, or
  uncomment it if it's already present and commented out:
+
[source,bash]
LOCAL_CODE => "$rc{GL_ADMIN_BASE}/local",

- To whitelist the notify-webhook keys modify the `GIT_CONFIG_KEYS` to
  include `hooks.webhookurl`:
+
[source,bash]
GIT_CONFIG_KEYS => 'hooks\.webhookurl',

Then call `gitolite setup` to apply the changes on the Gitolite server.

== Step 3: Install a git post-receive hook script

link:https://github.com/metajack/notify-webhook[notify-webhook] is a git
post-receive hook script that posts JSON data to a webhook capable
service like buddybuild. Download and install the webhook as follows on
a local Gitolite admin machine:

[source,bash]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metajack/notify-webhook/master/notify-webhook.py

mv notify-webhook.py gitolite-admin/local/hooks/repo-specific/notify-webhook

git add gitolite-admin/local/hooks/repo-specific/notify-webhook
----

== Step 4: Configure the post-receive webhook

Modify your `gitolite-admin/conf/gitolite.conf` file to register the git
post-receive hook named `notify-webhook`. Then configure the buddybuild
webhook URL that you copied from Step 1. The configuration for your
repository should look like this:

[source,bash]
----
repo my-ios-app
  option hook.post-receive = notify-webhook
  config hooks.webhookurl = "https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/api/webhook?appID=56fc8d0f9bdbfe01008b4f2c"
----

Commit and push the local Gitolite configuration changes to apply the
settings. The next time you push code to your repository buddybuild
automatically builds your app. Welcome to mobile continuous integration!
