  When you connect your Gitolite repository via SSH, buddybuild creates
  an SSH key (that you add to Gitolite) in order to build your app.

= Adding a Gitolite Repository

This page explains how to add a Gitolite hosted repository to
buddybuild. Let's get started!

First, if your repository is hosted on a Gitolite server, then you need
to link:../../quickstart/ssh.adoc[sign in with an email account].

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Enter the SSH Gitolite clone URL

List your repositories in Gitolite and note the repository name that you
would like to add to buddybuild.

--
[source,bash]
----
$ ssh git@my.company.com info
Hello Richie, this is git@my.company.com running gitolite3 v3.6.5-4-g6ed0156 on git 2.8.0

 R W  my-ios-app
 R W  my-android-app

Head over to dashboard, visit
link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/apps/wizard/build/select-source[Select
source] and choose **SSH**.

screen", 1500, 800]

Construct the Gitolite SSH clone URL using the username (typically `git`
or `gitolite` for most Gitolite installations), hostname, and repository
name.

[source,bash]
----
git@my.company.com:my-ios-app
----

[[step2]]
== Step 2: Add a buddybuild user to Gitolite

[NOTE]
======
**Only a Gitolite admin user can add new users**
======

In order to build your app on our fleet of build machines you will need
to create a new user that is authorized to read from your Gitolite
repository. When you enter the gitolite clone URL, buddybuild generates
an SSH key-pair that securely identifies your account in buddybuild.

Highlight and copy the generated public SSH key.

image:img/ssh-key.png["The buddybuild Connect another Git service
screen, with SSH key selected", 1500, 765]

To add a new Gitolite user named `buddybuild`, paste the public SSH key
into the file below, then commit and push the admin changes to your
gitolite server.

[source,bash]
gitolite-admin/keydir/buddybuild.pub

[[step3]]
== Step 3: Grant buddybuild access to your Gitolite repository

Modify your `gitolite-admin/conf/gitolite.conf` to grant `buddybuild`
read-only access to your repository.

[source,bash]
----
repo my-ios-app
    R = buddybuild
----

[NOTE]
======
**Automatic buddybuild SDK installation requires read-write access**

======

Granting buddybuild read-write access to your repository gives you the
option of *automatically* installing the buddybuild SDK at a later
point. To do this, modify your `gitolite-admin/conf/gitolite.conf` to
grant `buddybuild` read-write access to your repository.

[source,bash]
----
repo my-ios-app
    RW = buddybuild
----

This is an optional step, since with read-only access you can still
**manually** install the buddybuild SDK.

[WARNING]
=========
**Private git submodules and private cocoapods**

If your project depends on any code in other private git repositories,
the buddybuild user needs to be added to those repositories as well.
=========


[[step4]]
== Step 4: Build

Now go back to buddybuild and click on the **Build** button.

1500, 765]

Buddybuild clones your project code and starts a simulator build. The
build should finish within a few minutes.

That's it! Your Gitolite repository is now connected to buddybuild, and your
first build is under way. The next steps are:

- link:webhook.adoc[Add a Gitolite webhook] to automatically notify
  buddybuild of repository changes.

- link:../../quickstart/ios/invite_testers.adoc[invite testers] to try out
  your app.
