  When you connect your Kiln repository via SSH, buddybuild creates an
  SSH key (that you add to Kiln) in order to build your app.

= Add a Kiln Repository

If your repository lives in Kiln, you can connect to it via SSH.
Buddybuild automatically generates a secure SSH key for you to install
into Kiln. Buddybuild uses this key to clone your repository.

Let's get started!

buddybuild. Within the main page of that repository, look to the
top-right for the **Clone URL**. Click on the dropdown menu and select
**SSH**.

[WARNING]
=========
**Private git submodules and private cocoapods**

If your project depends on any code in other private git repositories,
the SSH key needs to be added to those repositories as well.

Navigate back to buddybuild and click on the **Build** button.

Buddybuild clones your project code and starts a simulator build. The
build should finish within a few minutes.

That's it! Your Kiln repository is now connected to buddybuild, and your
first build is under way. The next steps are:

- link:webhook.adoc[Add a Kiln webhook] to automatically notify
  buddybuild of repository changes.

- link:{{readme.path}}/quickstart/invite_testers.adoc[invite testers] to
  try out your app.
