= Adding a Kiln Repository

If your repository lives in Kiln, you can connect to it via SSH.
Buddybuild will automatically generate a secure SSH key for you to
install into your source control system. Buddybuild will use this key to
clone your repository.

Let's get started!

=========
**Private git submodules and private cocoapods**

If your project depends on any code in other private git repositories,
the SSH key needs to be added to those repositories as well.

Buddybuild will checkout your project code and kick off a simulator
build. The build should finish within a few seconds.

That's it. You're now connected to buddybuild. The next step is to
