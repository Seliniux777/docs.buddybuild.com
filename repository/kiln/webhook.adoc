= Adding a Kiln Webhook

A webhook notifies buddybuild of code changes you make to your
repository. Whenever a new change is pushed, buddybuild will
automatically build your app -- ensuring you have up-to-date build
status and your testers have the very latest changes.

Let's get started!

On the **Builds** page you will notice a big red banner labeled
*Looking for builds to be kicked off automatically?* To get started
click the **Resolve this issue** button.

In the dialog box that appears, **select and copy the webhook URL**.
This URL is specific to your app and will be used to identify your app
when sending webhooks from Kiln.

Navigate to your Kiln repository. On the top navigation bar, select
**Settings.**

Enter a name for the web hook, and then set the web hook **Type** to
**Custom**.

Paste the URL you first copied into the **URL** field.

In the **Repositories** field, start typing the name of your repository,
then select it. Remember that the buddybuild webhook URL is specific to
your app, so you must create a new web hook in Kiln for each app, even
if your repository contains multiple apps.

Finally, click the **Create web hook** button. You're now done!
