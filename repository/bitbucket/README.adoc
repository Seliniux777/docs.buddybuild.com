= Add a Bitbucket Repository

If your repository lives in Bitbucket, you can
link:{{readme.path}}/quickstart/connect/bitbucket.adoc[connect your
repository automatically], or connect via SSH if you prefer.

If you prefer SSH, buddybuild automatically generates a secure SSH key
for you to install into Bitbucket. Buddybuild uses this key to clone
your repository.

Let's get started!

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Enter the SSH Git Clone URL

Head over to Bitbucket and find the repository you would like to connect
with buddybuild. Within the main page of that repository, look to the
top-right for **HTTPS URL.** Click on the HTTPS dropdown menu and select
**SSH**.

[WARNING]
=========
**Private git submodules and private cocoapods**

If your project depends on any code in other private git repos, the SSH
key will need to be added to those repos as well.
=========

Navigate back to buddybuild and click on the **Build** button.

Buddybuild clones your project code and starts a simulator build. The
build should finish within a few minutes.

That's it! Your Bitbucket repository is now connected to buddybuild, and
your first build is under way. The next steps are:

- link:webhook.adoc[Add a Bitbucket webhook] to automatically notify
  buddybuild of repository changes.

- link:{{readme.path}}/quickstart/ios/invite_testers.adoc[invite
  testers] to try out your app.
