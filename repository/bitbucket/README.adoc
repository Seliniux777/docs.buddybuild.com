= Adding a Bitbucket Repository

If your repository lives in Bitbucket, you can
link:../../quickstart/bitbucket.adoc[connect your repository
automatically], or connect via SSH if you prefer.

If you prefer SSH, buddybuild will automatically generate a secure SSH
key for you to install into your source control system. Buddybuild will
use this key to clone your repository.

{% include "../../_common/important-ssh_access.adoc" %}

Let's get started!

[WARNING]
=========
**Private git submodules and private cocoapods**

If your project depends on any code in other private git repos, the SSH
key will need to be added to those repos as well.
=========

Navigate back to buddybuild and click on the **Build** button.

Buddybuild will checkout your project code and kick off a simulator
build. The build should finish within a few seconds.

That's it. You're now connected to buddybuild. The next step is to
link:../../quickstart/ios/invite_testers.adoc[invite testers] to try out
your App.
