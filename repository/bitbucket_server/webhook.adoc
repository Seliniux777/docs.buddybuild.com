= Add a Bitbucket Server webhook

A webhook notifies buddybuild of code changes that you make to your
repo. Whenever a new change is pushed to Bitbucket Server, buddybuild
automatically kicks off a new build -- ensuring that you have up-to-date
build status and your testers have the very latest builds.

**Step 1: Copy the webhook URL from buddybuild**

On the Builds page, in the red banner at the top of the page, click on
**Resolve this issue**.

buddybuild dashboard", 1500, 298]

In the dialog box that appears, **select and copy the webhook URL**.
This URL is specific to your app and will be used to identify your app
when sending webhooks from Bitbucket Server.

**Step 2: Add a new hook if the Web Post Hooks Plugin is not already
installed**

In Bitbucket Server, navigate to the repo that contains your app. In the
left navigation pane click **Settings**, then click on **Hooks**.

Bitbucket Server provides a plugin called *Post-Receive WebHooks*, which
is listed in the *Post receive* section of the *Hooks* page. If the
*Post-Receive WebHooks* plugin has already been installed then you can
skip ahead to **Step 5**. If the *Post-Receive WebHooks* plugin has not
listed, then you can add the plugin by clicking on the **Add hook**
button.

**Step 3: Select search to visit the Atlassian Marketplace**

The Atlassian Marketplace contains hundreds of useful plugins for
development. Click **Search** to visit the marketplace.

**Step 4: Install the Web Post Hooks Plugin**

Search for the *Bitbucket Server Web Post Hooks Plugin*. Then click
**Install**.

[WARNING]
=========
**Do not use "HTTP Request Post Receive Hook"**

Be careful not to choose the *HTTP Request Post Receive Hook* as this is
not compatible with buddybuild.

**Step 5: Configure the Post-Receive WebHooks**
From your repository settings page, select the **Post-Receive WebHooks**
plugin to configure the post receive events for buddybuild.

**Step 6: Enter the buddybuild webhook URL**
Enter the buddybuild webhook URL that you copied from Step 1. Then click
**Enable** to close the webhook editor dialog and enable. The next time
that you push code to your repository buddybuild will create a build for
your app. Please remember that you will need to install a separate
webhook for every app in buddybuild.
