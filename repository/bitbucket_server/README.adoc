= Adding a Bitbucket Server Repository

If your repository lives in Bitbucket Server (or Stash), you can sign
into buddybuild with your email. Buddybuild will automatically generate
a secure SSH key for you to install into your source control system.
Buddybuild will use this key to clone your repository.

Let's get started!

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Enter the SSH Git Clone URL

Head over to Bitbucket and find the repository you would like to connect
with buddybuild. Within the main page of that repository, look to the
top-right for **HTTPS URL.** Click on the HTTPS dropdown menu and select
**SSH**.

[WARNING]
=========
**Private git submodules and private cocoapods**

If your project depends on any code in other private git repos, the SSH
key will need to be added to those repos as well.

Navigate back to buddybuild and click on the **Build** button.

Buddybuild will checkout your project code and kick off a simulator
build. The build should finish within a few seconds.

That's it. You're now connected to buddybuild. The next step is to
link:../../quickstart/ios/invite_testers.adoc[invite testers] to try out
your App.
