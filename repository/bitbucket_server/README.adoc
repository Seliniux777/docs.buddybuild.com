= Adding a Bitbucket Server Repository

If your repository lives in Bitbucket Server (or Stash), you can sign
into buddybuild with your email. Buddybuild automatically generates
a secure SSH key for you to install into your source control system.
Buddybuild uses this key to clone your repository.

Let's get started!

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Enter the SSH Git Clone URL

Head over to Bitbucket and find the repository you would like to connect
with buddybuild. Within the main page of that repository, look to the
top-right for **HTTPS URL.** Click on the HTTPS dropdown menu and select
**SSH**.

Head back over to buddybuild and paste the SSH URL you copied into the
**Git Clone URL** field.

[WARNING]
=========
**Private git submodules and private cocoapods**

If your project depends on any code in other private git repos, the SSH
key will need to be added to those repos as well.

Navigate back to buddybuild and click on the **Build** button.

Buddybuild will checkout your project code and kick off a simulator
build. The build should finish within a few seconds.

That's it. You're now connected to buddybuild. The next step is to

your App.
